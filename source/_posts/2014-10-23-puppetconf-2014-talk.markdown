This year at Puppetconf 2014, I presented a 1.5 hour talk entitled "The Refactor
Dance" that comprised nearly EVERYTHING that I've written about in my Puppet
Workflows series (from writing better component modules, to Roles/Profiles,
to Workflow, and lots of stories in-between) as well as a couple of bad words,
a pair of leather pants (trousers), and an Uber story that beats your Uber
story. It's long, informative, and you get to watch the sweat stains under my
arms grow in an attractive grey Puppet Labs shirt.  What's not to love?
