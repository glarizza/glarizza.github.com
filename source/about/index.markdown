# Gary Larizza

I'm a professional services engineer for a little company called [Puppet Labs](http://www.puppetlabs.com)
in Portland, Oregon. You'll find me flying around talking about Puppet, OS X, Ruby, workflow, git, and
whatever else makes me happy. [Occasionally I engage in Norwegian axe-throwing.][andmyaxe]
