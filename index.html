  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hiera. That thing nobody is REALLY quite sure how to say (FYI: It&rsquo;s pronounced
&lsquo;hiera&rsquo;), the tool that everyone says you should be using, and the tool that
will make you hate YAML syntax errors with a passion. It&rsquo;s a data/code
separation dream, (potentially) a debugging nightmare, and absolutely vital in
creating a Puppet workflow that scales better than your company&rsquo;s Wifi strategy
(FYI: your company&rsquo;s Wifi password just changed. Again. Because they&rsquo;re not
using certificates). I&rsquo;ve already written a GOOD AMOUNT on why/how to use it,
but now I&rsquo;m going to give you a couple of edge cases. Call them &ldquo;best
practices&rdquo; (and I&rsquo;ll cut you), but I like to call it &ldquo;shit I learned
after using Hiera in anger.&rdquo; Here are a couple of the most popular questions
I hear, and my usual responses&hellip;</p>

<h2>&ldquo;How should I setup my hierarchy?&rdquo;</h2>

<p>This is such a subjective question because it&rsquo;s specific to your organization
(because it&rsquo;s your data). I usually ask back &ldquo;What are the things about your
nodes that are different, and when are they different?&rdquo; Usually I hear something
back like &ldquo;Well, nodes in this datacenter have different DNS settings&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Application servers in production use one version of java, and those in dev
use a different version&rdquo; or &ldquo;All machines in the dev environment in this datacenter
need to have a specific repository&rdquo;. All of these replies give me ideas to your
hierarchy.  When you think of Hiera as a giant conditional statment, you can
start seeing how your hierarchy could be laid out.  With the first response, we
know we need a <code>location</code> fact to determine where a node is, and then we can
have a hierarchy level for that location. The second response tells me we need
a level for the application tier (i.e. dev/test/prod).  The third response tells
me we need a level that combines both the location and the application tier. When
you add in that you should probably have a node-specific level at the top (for
overrides) and a default level at the bottom (or not: see the next section), I&rsquo;m
starting to picture this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">:hierarchy</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;nodes/%{::clientcert}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;%{::location}/%{::applicationtier}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;%{::location}/common&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;tier/%{::applicationtier}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">common</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Every time you have a need, you consider a level.  Now, obviously, it doesn&rsquo;t
mean that you NEED a level for every request (sometimes if it&rsquo;s an edge case
you can handle it in the profile or the role). There&rsquo;s a performance hit for
every level of your Hiera hierarchy, so ideally keep it minimal (or around
5 levels or so), but we&rsquo;re talking about flexibility here, and, if that&rsquo;s more
important than performance then you should go for it.</p>

<p>Next comes ordering. This one&rsquo;s SLIGHTLY easier &ndash; your hierarchy should read from
most-specific to least-specific. Note that when you specify an application tier
at a specific location that that it is MORE specific than just saying &ldquo;all nodes in
this application tier.&rdquo; Sometimes you will have levels that might be hard to
define an order &ndash; such as location vs. application tier. You kinda just have to
go with your gut here. In many cases you may find that the data you put in those
two levels will be entirely different (location-based data may not ever overlap
with application-tier-specific data). Do remember than any time you change the
order of your hierarchy you&rsquo;re going to introduce the possibility that values
get flip/flopped.</p>

<p>If you look at level 3 of the hierarchy above, you&rsquo;ll see that I have &lsquo;common&rsquo;
at the end. Some people like this syntax (where they put a &lsquo;common&rsquo; file in a
folder that matches the fact they&rsquo;re checking against), and some people prefer
a filename matching the fact.  Do what makes you happy, but, in this case,
we can unify the location folder and just put the common file underneath the
application tier files.</p>

<p>Finally, DO MAKE USE OF FOLDERS!  For the love of god, this. Putting all files
in a single folder both makes that a BIG folder, but also introduces a namespace
collision (i.e. what if you have a location named &lsquo;dev&rsquo; for example? Now you have
both an application tier and a location with the same name.  Oops).</p>

<p>How you setup your hierarchy is up to you, but this should hopefully give you
somewhere to start.</p>

<h2>An argument AGAINST {global,common}.yaml</h2>

<p>I might as well drum up some controversy now&hellip;</p>

<p>When using Hiera, you need to define a hierarchy that Hiera uses in its search
for your data. Most often, it looks something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>hiera.yaml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="nn">---</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">:backends</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">yaml</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">:yaml</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">:datadir</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hieradata</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">:hierarchy</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;nodes/%{::clientcert}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;location/%{::location}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;environment/%{::applicationtier}&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">common</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that little &ldquo;common&rdquo; at the end?  That means that, failing everything
else, it&rsquo;s going to look in <code>common.yaml</code> for a value.  This means that
<code>common.yaml</code> is a storage bin of default values.</p>

<p>Previously, you may have heard me rail against Hiera&rsquo;s optional second argument
and how I really don&rsquo;t like it.  Take this example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='puppet'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">hiera</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;port&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;80&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Given this code, Hiera is going to look for a parameter called &lsquo;port&rsquo; in its
hierarchy, and, if it doesn&rsquo;t find one in ANY of the levels, assign back a default
value of &lsquo;80&rsquo;.  I don&rsquo;t like using this second argument because:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you forget to enter the &lsquo;port&rsquo; parameter into the hierarchy, or typo it in the YAML file, Hiera will gladly assign the default value of &lsquo;80&rsquo; (which, unless you&rsquo;re checking for this, might sneak and get into production)</li>
<li>Where is the real &lsquo;default&rsquo; value: the value in <code>common.yaml</code> or the optional second argument?</li>
</ol>


<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re resigned to never use the second argument.  Cool.  BUT, what
happens when you already have a value in <code>common.yaml</code> and you typo the name
of the parameter at a higher level (for example, you write &ldquo;prot: 44&rdquo; inside
a YAML file at a higher level)?  You&rsquo;re going to get the value in <code>common.yaml</code>,
and, again, unless you&rsquo;re watching for this, suddenly you get a default value
when you didn&rsquo;t expect it.</p>

<p>So, what is this value in <code>common.yaml</code> used for anyways? Well, it&rsquo;s a value
default for every node that needs it.  And where are we going to be getting
this value?  If you said &ldquo;The Profile&rdquo;, you would be correct.  So what should
we do about this?  I say you hardcode the value right into the Profile (GASP!!)
I will talk about this more in the next section (because it&rsquo;s more appropriate
there), so just hold that thought for another section.</p>

<p>Until then, let me say that I&rsquo;ve started to align myself with the idea that
<code>hiera.yaml</code> shouldn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; level.  The idea is that if there&rsquo;s
a value that every node should have, keep it visible and in the Profile. If
you need Hiera&rsquo;s dynamic lookup capability, THEN drop it into the hierarchy.
The downside of this philosophy is that you&rsquo;ll suddenly need to enter a value
in many different places (i.e. if suddenly you want to define a different port
in the &lsquo;dev&rsquo; application tier than in all the other application tiers, then you
need to add the port parameter to EVERY ONE of your application tier files. If
you have 8 of these tiers, then you need to enter the value into all 8 files).
This is also less-than-ideal, but what are you optimizing for here?  You&rsquo;re
optimizing for early failure.  If Hiera can&rsquo;t find a value and it SHOULD, this
is an early failure at catalog compilation time. You&rsquo;ll know INSTANTLY that
there&rsquo;s a problem (instead of deploying a default value to production, for
example).</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t need this level of optimization, by all means keep the default
level.  If you don&rsquo;t want this much redundancy by entering values in multiple
files, by all means keep the default level.  I simply offer forth a solution
for those folks who are wanting a &ldquo;fail-early, fail-often&rdquo; approach in their
data lookup mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You&rsquo;re never going to completely escape the idea of typos. Even
if you remove the &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; level in the hierarchy, you could still have the
case where you enter a port value in every file at the <code>$::applicationtier</code>
level, but maybe typo the parameter at a higher level.  In this case, Hiera
DOES return a value, but it&rsquo;s the <code>$::applicationtier</code> value.  This requires
&ldquo;CONSTANT VIGILANCE!&rdquo; to catch these cases, but the idea is that these edge
cases are much less than a defaults-level override, so you SHOULD be able to
spot it easier. No level of automation will totally remove human error (and
watch The Matrix if you don&rsquo;t believe me).</p>

<h2>Where to data &ndash; Hiera or Profile?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Does this go right into the Profile or into Hiera?&rdquo;  I get that question
repeatedly when I&rsquo;m working with customers. It&rsquo;s a good question, and one of
the quickest ways to blow up your YAML files in Hiera. Here&rsquo;s the order I use
when deciding where to put data:</p>

<h3>Enter the data into the Profile itself</h3>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what I said &ndash; put it in the Profile.  &ldquo;BUT GARY!&rdquo;, you
should be thinking, &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S EMBEDDING DATA INSIDE YOUR PUPPET CODE!&rdquo;  To that
I say: &ldquo;It depends on how you look at the problem and solution.&rdquo; The profile is
YOUR implementation.  It describes how YOU define the implementation of a piece
of technology in YOUR organization. As such, it&rsquo;s less about Puppet code and
more about pulling data and passing it TO the Puppet code. It&rsquo;s the glue-code
that grabs the data and wires it up to the model that uses it. How it grabs the
data is not really a big deal, so long as it grabs the RIGHT data &ndash; right? You
can choose to hardcode it into the Profile, or use Hiera, or use some other
magical data lookup mechanism &ndash; we don&rsquo;t really care (so long as the Profile
gathers the data and passes it to the correct Puppet class).</p>

<p>&ldquo;BUT GARY! IT&rsquo;S GOING TO MAKE IT HARD TO DEBUG!&rdquo;  Not really. You&rsquo;re going to
have to open the Profile anyway to see what&rsquo;s going on (whether you pull the
data from Hiera or hardcode it in the Profile), right? And, arguably, the
Profile is legible&hellip;doing Hiera lookups gives you flexibility at a cost of
abstracting away how it got that bit of data (i.e. &ldquo;It used Hiera&rdquo;). For newer
users of Puppet, having the data in the Profile is easier to follow. So, in the
end, putting the data into the Profile itself is the least-flexible and most-visible
option&hellip;so consequently it should be the first available option. This option
is best for defaults that are applicable for ALL nodes.</p>

<p>Remember when I offered that crazy idea of not having a &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; level in the
hierarchy?  This is why: erring on the side of visibility in the Profile and
failing early with Hiera. It also gives you a logical starting point when
determining WHERE to put your data.  Moving along&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Data is clearly visible and legible in the profile (no need to open additional files)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Inability to redefine variables in Puppet DSL makes any settings constants by default (i.e. no overriding permitted)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Enter the data into Hiera</h3>

<p>If you find that you need to have different bits of data for different nodes
(i.e. a different version of Java in the dev tier instead of the prod tier),
then you can start to put the data into Hiera.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you subscribe to my &ldquo;no defaults&rdquo; philosophy above, you suddenly
need to enter the data into as many files as that level of the hierarchy has
(or more if you override at a higher level). Understand that you&rsquo;re not me,
and you DON&rsquo;T NEED to subscribe to this &ldquo;no defaults&rdquo; view of the world. Yay
for being different!</p>

<p>Where to put the data is going to depend on your own needs &ndash; I&rsquo;m trusting that
you can figure this part out :)</p>

<p>This answers that &ldquo;where&rdquo; question, but doesn&rsquo;t answer the &ldquo;what&rdquo; question&hellip;as
in &ldquo;What data should I put into Hiera?&rdquo;  For that, we have another section&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Flexibility in returning different values based on different conditions</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Visibility &ndash; you must do a Hiera lookup to find the value (or open Hiera&rsquo;s YAML files)</li>
</ul>


<h2>&ldquo;What exactly goes into Hiera?&rdquo;</h2>

<p>If there were one question that, if answered incorrectly, could make or break
your Puppet deployment, this would be it. The greatest strength and weakness of
Hiera is its flexibility.  You can truly put almost anything in Hiera, and, when
combined with something like the create_resources() function, you can create
your own YAML configuration language (tip: don&rsquo;t actually do this).</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, seriously, what should go into Hiera, and what shouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The important thing to consider here is the price you pay by putting data into
Hiera. You&rsquo;re gaining flexibility at a cost of visibility.  This means that you
can do things like enter values at all level of the hierarchy that can be
concatenated together with a single hiera_array() call, BUT, you&rsquo;re losing the
visibility of having the data right in front of you (i.e. you need to open up
all the YAML files individually, or use the <code>hiera</code> binary to debug how you got
those values). Hiera is REALLY COOL until you have to debug why it grabbed (or
DIDN&rsquo;T grab) a particular value.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I usually tell people about what should be put into Hiera:</p>

<ul>
<li>The exact data values that need to be different conditionally (i.e. a different ntp server for different sites, different java versions in dev/prod, a password hash, etc.)</li>
<li>Dynamic data expressed in multiple levels of the hierarchy (i.e. a lookup for &lsquo;packages&rsquo; that returns back an array of all the values that were found in all the levels of the hierarchy)</li>
<li>Resources as a hash ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY</li>
</ul>


<h3>Puppet manifest vs. create_resources()</h3>

<p>Bullets 1 and 2 above should be pretty straightforward &ndash; you either need to use
Hiera to grab a specific value or return back a list of ALL the values from ALL
the levels of the hierarchy. The point here is that Hiera should be returning
back only the minimal amount of data that is necessary (i.e. instead of
returning back a hash that contains the title of the resource, all the attributes
of the resource, and all the attribute values for that resource, just return
back a specific value that will be assigned to an attribute&hellip;like the password
hash itself for a user). This data lookup appears to be &ldquo;magic&rdquo; to new users of
Puppet &ndash; all they see is the magic phrase of &ldquo;hiera&rdquo; and a parameter to search
for &ndash; and so it becomes slightly confusing. It IS, however, easier to understand
that this magical phrase will return data, and that that data is going to be used
to set the value for an attribute. Consider this example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This leads us to bullet 3, which is &ldquo;the Hiera + create_resources() solution.&rdquo;
This solution allows you to lookup data from within Hiera and pass it directly
to a function where Puppet creates the individual resources as if you had typed
them into a Puppet manifest itself. The previous example can be entered into
a Hiera YAML file like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>sysadmins.yaml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">users</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">gary</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">ensure</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;present&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">uid</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;5001&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">gid</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;gary&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">shell</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;zsh&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">password</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;biglongpasswordhash&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And then a resource can be created inside the Puppet DSL by doing the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Both examples are functionally identical, except the first one only uses Hiera
to get the password hash value, whereas the second one grabs both the
attributes, and their values, for a specific resource. Imagine Puppet gives you
an error with the &lsquo;gary&rsquo; user resource and you were using the latter example.
You grep your Puppet code looking for &lsquo;gary&rsquo;, but you won&rsquo;t find that user
resource in your Puppet manifest anywhere (because it&rsquo;s being created with the create_resources() function).
You will instead have to know to go into Hiera&rsquo;s data directory, then the
correct datafile, and then look for the hash of values for the &lsquo;gary&rsquo; user.</p>

<h3>Functional differences between the two approaches</h3>

<p>Functionally, you COULD do this either way. When you come up with a solution
using create_resources(), I challenge you to draw up another solution using
Puppet code in a Puppet manifest (however lengthy it may be) that queries Hiera
for ONLY the specific values necessary. Consider this example, but, instead,
you need to manage 500 users.
If you use create_resources(), you would then need to add 500 more blocks to
the &lsquo;users&rsquo; parameter in your Hiera datafiles.  That&rsquo;s a lot of YAML. And on
what level will you add these blocks? <code>prod.yaml</code>? <code>dev.yaml</code>? Are you using a
<code>common.yaml</code>? Your YAML files suddenly got huge, and the rest of your team
modifying them will not be so happy to scroll through 500 entries. Now consider
the first example using Puppet code. Your Puppet manifest suddenly grew, but it
didn&rsquo;t affect all the OTHER manifests out there: only this file. The Hiera YAML
files will still grow &ndash; but now 500 individual lines instead of 3000 lines in
the previous example. Okay, now which one is more LEGIBLE? I would argue that
the Puppet manifest is more legible, because I consider the Puppet DSL to be
very legible (again, subject to debate versus YAML). Moreover, when debugging,
you can stay inside Puppet files more often using Puppet manifests to define
your resources. Using create_resources, you need to jump into Hiera more often.
That&rsquo;s a context shift, which adds more annoyance to debugging. Also, it
creates multiple &ldquo;sources of truth.&rdquo; Suddenly you have the ability of entering
data in Hiera as well as entering it in the Puppet manifest, which may be clear
to YOU, but if you leave the company, or you get another person on your team,
they may choose to abuse the Hiera settings without knowing why.</p>

<p>Now consider an example that you might say is more tailored to create_resources().
Say you have a defined type that sets up tomcat applications. This defined type
accepts things like a path to install the application, the application&rsquo;s package
name, the version, which tomcat installation to target, and etc. Now consider
that all application servers need application1, but only a couple
of servers need application2, and a very snowflake server needs application3 (in
this case, we&rsquo;re NOT saying that all applications are on all boxes and that their
data, like the version they&rsquo;re using, is different. We&rsquo;re actually saying that
different machines require entirely different applications).</p>

<p>Using Hiera + create_resources() you could enter the resource for the
application1 at a low level, then, at a higher level, add the resource for
application2, and finally add the resource for application3 at the
node-specific level. In the end, you can do a hiera_hash() lookup to discover
and concatenate all resources from all levels of the hierarchy and pipe that to
create_resources.</p>

<p>How would you do this with Puppet code?  Well, I would create profiles for every
application, and either different roles for the different kinds of servers (i.e.
the snowflake machine gets its own role), or conditional checks inside the role
(i.e. if this node is at the London location, it gets these application profiles,
and etc&hellip;).</p>

<p>Now which is more legible? At this point, I&rsquo;d still say that separate profiles
and conditional checks in roles (or sub-roles) are more legible &ndash; including
a class is a logical thing to follow, and conditionals inside Puppet code are
easy to follow. The create_resources() solution just becomes magic. Suddenly,
applications are on the node. If you want to know where they came from, you
have to switch contexts and open Hiera data files or use the <code>hiera</code> binary
and do a debug run. If you&rsquo;re a small team that&rsquo;s been using Puppet forever,
then rock on and go for it. If you&rsquo;re just getting started, though, I&rsquo;d shy
away.</p>

<h3>Final word on create_resources?</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I'll use create_resources()."
</span><span class='line'>Now they have two problems.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The create_resources() function is often called the &ldquo;PSE Swiss Army knife&rdquo;
(or, Professional Services Engineer &ndash; the people who do what
I do and consult with our customers) because we like to break it out when we&rsquo;re
painted into a corner by customer requirements. It will work ANYWHERE, but, again,
at that cost of visibility. I am okay with someone using it so long as they
understand the cost of visibility and the potential debugging issues they&rsquo;ll hit.
I will always argue against using it, however, for those reasons. More code in
a Puppet manifest is not a bad thing&hellip;especially if it&rsquo;s reasonably legible
code that can be kept to a specific class. Consider the needs and experience
level of your team before using create_resources() &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t have a good
reason for using it, simply don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h3>create_resources()</h3>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamically iterate and create resources based on Hiera data</li>
<li>Using Hiera&rsquo;s hash merging capability, you can functionally override resource values at higher levels of the hierarchy</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Decreased visibility</li>
<li>Becomes a second &lsquo;source of truth&rsquo; to Puppet</li>
<li>Can increase confusion about WHERE to manage resources</li>
<li>When used too much, it creates a DSL to Puppet&rsquo;s DSL (DSLs all the way down)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Puppet DSL + single Hiera lookup</h3>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>More visible (sans the bit of data you&rsquo;re looking up)</li>
<li>Using wrapper classes allows for flexibility and conditional inclusion of resources/classes</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Very explicit &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t have the dynamic overriding capability like Hiera does</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using Hiera as an ENC</h2>

<p>One of the early &ldquo;NEAT!&rdquo; moments everyone has with Hiera is using it as an
External Node Classifier, or ENC. There is a function called <code>hiera_include()</code>
that allows you to include classes into the catalog as if you were to write
&ldquo;include (classname)&rdquo; in a Puppet manifest.  It works like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>london.yaml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">classes</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">profiles::london::base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">profiles::london::network</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>dev.yaml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">classes</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">profiles::tomcat::application2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>site.pp</span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='puppet'><span class='line'><span class="kd">node</span> <span class="s">default</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nf">hiera_include</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;classes&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Given the above example, the hiera_include() function will search every level
of the hierarchy looking for a parameter called &lsquo;classes&rsquo;. It returns
a concatenated list of classnames, which it then passes to Puppet&rsquo;s include()
function (in the end, Puppet will declare the profiles::london::base,
profiles::london::network, and profiles::tomcat::application2 classes). Puppet
puts the contents of these classes into the catalog, and away we go. This is
awesome because you can change the classification of a node conditionally
according to a Hiera lookup, and it&rsquo;s terrible because you can CHANGE THE
CLASSIFICATION OF A NODE CONDITIONALLY ACCORDING TO A HIERA LOOKUP!  This means
that anyone with access to the repo holding your Hiera data files can affect
changes to every node in Puppet just by modifying a magical key. It also means
that in order to see the classification for a node, you need to do a Hiera
lookup (i.e. you can&rsquo;t just open a file and see it).</p>

<p>Remember that WHOLE blog post about Roles and Profiles?  I do, because I wrote
the damn thing. <a href="http://bit.ly/puppetworkflows2">You can even go back and read it again, too, if you want to.</a>
One of the core tenets of that article was that each node get classified with a
single role. If you adhere to that (and you should; it makes for a much more
logical Puppet deployment), a node really only ever needs to be classified
ONCE. You don&rsquo;t NEED this conditional classification behavior. It&rsquo;s one of those
&ldquo;It seemed like a good idea at the time&rdquo; moments that I assure you will pass.</p>

<p>Now, you CAN use Roles with hiera_include() &ndash; simply create a Facter fact that
returns the node&rsquo;s role, add a level to the Hiera hierarchy for this role fact,
and in the role&rsquo;s YAML file in Hiera, simply do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>appserver.yaml </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">classes</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">role::application_server</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you can use the same hiera_include() call in the default node definition
in <code>site.pp</code>. The ONLY time I recommend this is if you don&rsquo;t already have some
other classification method. The downside of this method is that if your role
fact CHANGES, for some reason or another, classification immediately changes.
Facts are NOT secure &ndash; they can be overridden really easily. I don&rsquo;t like to
leave classification to an insecure method that anyone with root access on a
machine can change. Using an ENC or <code>site.pp</code> for classification means that the
node ABSOLUTELY CANNOT override its classification. It&rsquo;s the difference between
being authoritative and simply &lsquo;suggesting&rsquo; a classification.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamic classification: no need to maintain a site.pp file or group in the Console</li>
<li>Fact-based: a node&rsquo;s classification can change immediately when its role fact does</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Decreased visibility: need to do a Hiera lookup to determine classification</li>
<li>Insecure: since facts are insecure and can be overridden, so can classification</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Bindings</h2>

<p>In Puppet 3, we introduced the concept of &lsquo;data bindings&rsquo; for parameterized classes,
which meant that Puppet now had another choice for gathering parmeter values.
Previously, the order Puppet would look to assign a value for parameters to
classes was:</p>

<ol>
<li>A value passed to the class via the parameterized class syntax</li>
<li>A default value provided by the class</li>
</ol>


<p>As of Puppet 3, this is the new parameter assignment order:</p>

<ol>
<li>A value passed to the class via the parameterized class syntax</li>
<li>A Hiera lookup for <em>classname::parametername</em></li>
<li>A default value provided by the class</li>
</ol>


<p>Data bindings is meant to be pluggable to allow for ANY data backend, but,
as of this writing, there&rsquo;s currently only one: Hiera.  Because of this,
Puppet will now automatically do a Hiera lookup for every parameter to a
parameterized class that isn&rsquo;t explicitly passed a value via the parameterized
class syntax (which means that if you just do <code>include classname</code>, Puppet
will do a Hiera lookup for EVERY parameter defined to the &ldquo;classname&rdquo; class).</p>

<p>This is really cool because it means that you can just add <em>classname::parametername</em>
to your Hiera setup, and, as long as you&rsquo;re not EXPLICITLY passing that
parameter&rsquo;s value to the class, Puppet will do a lookup and find the value.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also completely transparent to you unless you know it&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p>The issue here is that this is new functionality to Puppet, and it feels like
magic to me. You can make the argument and say &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t start using it,
Gary, people will never take to it,&rdquo; however I feel like this kind of magical
lookup in the background is always going to be a bad thing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also another problem.  Consider a Hiera hierarchy that has 15 levels
(they exist, TRUST ME).  What happens if you don&rsquo;t define ANY parameters in
Hiera in the form of <em>classname::parametername</em> and simply want to rely on
the default values for every class?  Well, it means that Hiera is STILL going
to be triggered for every parameter to a class that isn&rsquo;t explicitly passed a
value.  That&rsquo;s a hell of a performance hit.  Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a way to
disable this lookup.  Simply add the following to the Puppet master&rsquo;s <code>puppet.conf</code>
file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>data_binding_terminus = none</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s going to be up to how your team needs to work as to whether you use Hiera
data bindings or not. If you have a savvy team that feels they can debug these
lookups, then cool &ndash; use the hell out of it. I prefer to err on the side of an
explicit hiera() lookup for every value I&rsquo;m querying, even if it&rsquo;s a lot of extra
lines of code. I prefer the visibility, especially for new members to your team.
For those people with large hierarchies, you may want to weigh the performance
hit.  Try to disable data bindings and see if your master is more performant. If
so, then explicit hiera() calls may actually buy you some rewards.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Adding parameters to Hiera in the style of <em>classname::parametername</em> will set parameterized class values automatically</li>
<li>Simplified code &ndash; simply use the include() function everywhere (which is safer than the parameterized class syntax)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lookup is completely transparent unless you know what&rsquo;s going on</li>
<li>Debugging parameter values can be difficult (especially with typos or forgetting to set values in Hiera)</li>
<li>Performance hit for values you want to be assigned the class default value</li>
</ul>

Puppet, its dependency model, and why &lsquo;ordering&rsquo; is not necessarily the way to

<h2>Why Puppet doesn&rsquo;t care about execution order (until it does)</h2>

<p>The biggest shock to the system when getting started with a declarative (ish)
configuration management tool like Puppet is understanding that Puppet describes
the end-state of the machine, and NOT the order that it&rsquo;s (Puppet) going to
take you to that state. To Puppet, the order that it chooses to affect change
in any resource (be it a file to be corrected, a package to be installed, or
any other resource type) is entirely arbitrary because resources that have no
relationship to another resource shouldn&rsquo;t CARE about the order in which they&rsquo;re
evaluated and remediated.</p>

<p>For example, imagine Puppet is going to create both <code>/etc/sudoers</code> and update
the system&rsquo;s authorized keys file to enter all the sysadmins&#8217; SSH keys. Which
one should it do first? In an imperative system like shell scripts or
a runbook-style system, you are forced to choose an order. So I ask again,
which one goes first? If you try to update the <code>sudoers</code> file in your script
first, and there&rsquo;s a problem with that update, then the script fails and the
SSH keys aren&rsquo;t installed. If you switch the order and there&rsquo;s a problem with
the SSH keys, then you can&rsquo;t <code>sudo</code> up because the <code>sudoers</code> file hasn&rsquo;t been
touched.</p>

<p>Because of this, Puppet has always taken the stance that if there are failures,
we want to get as much of the system into a working state as possible (i.e. any
resources that don&rsquo;t depend upon the failing resource are going to still be
evaluated, or &lsquo;inspected&rsquo;, and remediated, or &lsquo;changed if need be&rsquo;). There are
definitely philosophical differences here: the argument can be made that if there&rsquo;s
a failure somewhere, the system is bad and you should cast it off until you&rsquo;ve
fixed whatever the problem is (or the part of the code causing the problem). In
virtualized or &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; environments where everything is automated, this is just
fine, but in environments without complete and full automation, sometimes you
have to fix and deal with what you have. Puppet &ldquo;believes in your system&rdquo;, which
is borderline marketing-doubletalk for &ldquo;alert you of errors and give you time
to fix the damn thing and do another Puppet run without having to spin up a whole
new system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once you know WHY Puppet takes the stance it does, you realize that Puppet does
not give two shits about the order of resources without dependencies. If you
write perfect Puppet code, you&rsquo;re fine. But the majority of the
known-good-world does not do that. In fact, most of us write shit code. Which
was the problem&hellip;</p>

<h2>The history of Puppet&rsquo;s ordering choices</h2>

<h3>&lsquo;Random&rsquo; random order</h3>

<p>In the early days, the only resources that were guaranteed to have a consistent
order were those resources with dependencies (i.e. as I stated above, resources
that used the &lsquo;before&rsquo;, &lsquo;require&rsquo;, &lsquo;subscribe&rsquo;, or &lsquo;notify&rsquo; metaparameters to
establish an evaluation order). Every other resource was evaluted at random
every time that Puppet ran&hellip;which meant that you could run Puppet ten times
and, theoretically, resources without dependencies could be evaluated in
a different order between every Puppet run (we call this non-deterministic
ordering). This made things REALLY hard to debug.  Take the case where you had
a catalog of thousands of resources but you forgot a SINGLE dependency between
a couple of file resources. If you roll that change out to 1000 nodes, you
might have 10 or less of them fail (because Puppet chose an evaluation order
that ordered these two resources incorrectly). Imagine trying to figure out
what happened and replicate the problem. You could waste lots of time just
trying to REPLICATE the issue, even if it was a small fix like this.</p>

<p><strong>PROS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>IS there a pro here?</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ordering could change between runs, and thus it was very hard to debug missing dependencies</li>
</ul>


<p>Philosophically, we were correct: resources that are to be evaluated in a certain
order require dependencies. Practically, we were creating more work for ourselves.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I&rsquo;d heard that Adam Jacob, who created Chef, had cited this reason
as one of the main motivators for creating Chef. I&rsquo;d heard that as a Puppet
consultant, he would run into these buried dependency errors and want to flip
tables. Even if it&rsquo;s not a true STORY, it was absolutely true for tables where
I used to work&hellip;</p>

<h3>Title-hash, &lsquo;Predictable&rsquo; random order</h3>

<p>Cut to Puppet version 2.7 where we introduced deterministic ordering with
&lsquo;title-hash&rsquo; ordering. In a nutshell, resources that didn&rsquo;t have dependencies
would still be executed in a random order, but the order Puppet chose could be
replicated (it created a SHA1 hash based on the titles of the resources without
dependencies, and ordered the hashes alphabetically). This meant that if you
tested out a catalog on a node, and then ran that same catalog on 1000 other
nodes, Puppet would choose the same order for all 1000 of the nodes. This
gave you the ability to actually TEST whether your changes would successfully
run in production. If you omitted a dependency, but Puppet managed to pick the
correct evaluation order, you STILL had a missing dependency, but you didn&rsquo;t
care about it because the code worked. The next change you made to the catalog
(by adding or removing resources), the order might change, but you would
discover and fix the dependency at that time.</p>

<p><strong>PROS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Predictable&rsquo; and repeatable order made testing possible</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to miss dependency omissions if Puppet chose the right order (but do you really care?)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Manifest ordering, the &lsquo;bath salts&rsquo; of ordering</h3>

<p>Title-hash ordering seemed like the best of both worlds &ndash; being opinionated about
resource dependencies but also giving sysadmins a reliable, and repeatable, way
to test evaluation order before it&rsquo;s pushed out to production.</p>

<p>Buuuuuuuuuut, y&#8217;all JUST weren&rsquo;t happy enough, were you?</p>

<p>When you move from an imperative solution like scripts to a declarative(ish)
solution like Puppet, it is absolutely a new way to think about modeling your
system. Frequently we heard that people were having issues with Puppet because
the order that resources shows up in a Puppet master WASN&rsquo;T the order that Puppet
would evaluate the resources. I just dropped a LOT of words explaining why this
isn&rsquo;t the case, but who really has the time to read up on all of this? People
were dismissing Puppet too quickly because their expectations of how the tool
worked didn&rsquo;t align with reality. The assumption, then, was to align these
expectations in the hopes that people wouldn&rsquo;t dismiss Puppet so quickly.</p>

<p><a href="http://puppetlabs.com/blog/introducing-manifest-ordered-resources">Eric Sorenson wrote a blog post on our thesis and experimentation</a>
around manifest ordering that is worth a read (and, incidentally, is shorter
than this damn post), but the short version is that we tested this theory out
and determined that Manifest Ordering would help new users to Puppet. Because
of this work, we created a feature called &lsquo;Manifest Ordering&rsquo; that stated that
resources that DID NOT HAVE DEPENDENCIES would be evaluated by Puppet in the
order that they showed up in the Puppet manifest (when read top to bottom). If
a resource truly does not have any dependencies, then you honestly should not
care one bit what order it&rsquo;s evaluated (because it doesn&rsquo;t matter).  Manifest
Ordering made ordering of resources without dependencies VERY predictable.</p>

<p>But&hellip;.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean I think it&rsquo;s the best thing in the world. In fact, I&rsquo;m really
wary of how I feel people will come to use Manifest Ordering. There&rsquo;s a reason
I called it the &ldquo;bath salts of ordering&rdquo; &ndash; because a little bit of it, when
used correctly, can be a lovely thing, but too much of it, used in unintended
circumstances, leads to hypothermia, paranoia, and the desire to gnaw someone
else&rsquo;s face off. We were/are giving you a way to bypass our dependency model by
using the mental-model you had with scripts, but ALSO telling you NOT to rely
on that mental-model (and instead set dependencies explicitly using metaparameters).</p>

<p>Seriously, what could go wrong?</p>

<p>Manifest Ordering is not a substitution for setting dependencies &ndash; that IS NOT
what it was created for. <strong>Puppet Labs still maintains that you should use
dependencies to order resources and NOT simply rely on Manifest Ordering as
a form of setting dependencies!</strong> Again, the problem is that you need to KNOW
this&hellip;and if Manifest Ordering allows you to keep the same imperative
&ldquo;mindset&rdquo; inside a declarative(ish) language, then eventually you&rsquo;re going to
experience pain (if not today, but possibly later when you actually try to
refactor code, or share code, or use this code on a system that ISN&rsquo;T using
Manifest Ordering). A declarative(ish) language like Puppet requires seeing
your systems according to the way their end-state will look and worrying about
WHAT the system will look like, and not necessarily HOW it will get there. Any
shortcut to understanding this process means you&rsquo;re going to miss key bits of
what makes Puppet a good tool for modeling this state.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Evaluation order of resources without dependencies is absolutely predictable</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If used as a substitution for setting dependencies, then refactoring code (moving around the order in which resources show up in a manifest) means changing the evaluation order</li>
</ul>


<h2>What should I actually take from this?</h2>

<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s a list of things you SHOULD be doing if you don&rsquo;t want to create
a problem for future-you or future-organization:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use dependency metaparameters like &lsquo;before&rsquo;, &lsquo;require&rsquo;, &lsquo;notify&rsquo;, and &lsquo;subscribe&rsquo; if resources in a catalog NEED to be evaluated in a particular order</li>
<li>Do not use Manifest Ordering as a substitute for explicitly setting dependencies (disable it if this is too tempting)</li>
<li>Use Roles and Profiles for a logical module layout (see: <a href="http://bit.ly/puppetworkflows2">http://bit.ly/puppetworkflows2</a> for information on Roles and Profiles)</li>
<li>Order individual components inside the Profile</li>
<li>Order Profiles (if necessary) inside the Role</li>
</ul>


<p>And, seriously, trust us with the explicit dependencies. It seems like a giant
pain in the ass initially, but you&rsquo;re ultimately documenting your infrastructure,
and a dependency (or, saying &lsquo;this thing MUST come before that thing&rsquo;) is a pretty
important decision. There&rsquo;s a REASON behind it &ndash; treat it with some more weight
other than having one line come before another line, ya know? The extra time
right now is absolutely going to buy you the time you spend at home with your
kids (and by &lsquo;kids&rsquo;, I mean &lsquo;XBox&rsquo;).</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t use bath salts, folks.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;ve read anything I&rsquo;ve posted in the past year, you know my feelings about
the word &lsquo;environments&rsquo; and about how well we tend to name things here at
Puppet Labs (and if you don&rsquo;t, <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/03/26/random-r10k-workflow-ideas/">you can check out that post here</a>).
Since then, Puppet Labs has released a new feature called <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments.html">directory
environments (click this link for further reading)</a>
that replace the older &lsquo;config file environments&rsquo; that we all used to use (i.e.
stanzas in puppet.conf).  Directory environments weren&rsquo;t without their false
starts and issues, but further releases of Puppet, and their inclusion in
Puppet Enterprise 3.3.0, have allowed more people
to ask about them.  SO, I thought I&rsquo;d do a quick writeup about them&hellip;</p>

<h2>R10k had a child: Directory Environments</h2>

<p>The Puppet platform team had a couple of problems with config file environments
in puppet.conf &ndash; namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entering them in puppet.conf meant that you couldn&rsquo;t use environments named &lsquo;master&rsquo;, &lsquo;main&rsquo;, or &lsquo;agent&rsquo;</li>
<li>There was no easy/reliable way to determine all the available/used Puppet environments without making assumptions (and hacky code) &ndash; especially if someone were using R10k + dynamic environments</li>
<li>Adding more environments to <code>puppet.conf</code> made managing that file something of a nightmare (<code>environments.d</code> anyone?)</li>
</ul>


<p>Combine this with the fact that <a href="http://bit.ly/puppetworkflows3">most of the Professional Services team was
rolling out R10k to create dynamic environments</a> (which meant we
were abusing <code>$environment</code> inside <code>puppet.conf</code> and creating environments&hellip;well&hellip;
dynamically and on-the-fly), and they knew something needed to be done.
Because R10k was so popular and widely deployed, an environment solution that
was a simple step-up from an R10k deployment was made the target, and directory
environments were born.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Directory environments, essentially, are born out of a folder on the Puppet master
(typically <code>$confdir/environments</code>, where <code>$confdir</code> is <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet</code>
in Puppet Enterprise) wherein every subfolder is a new Puppet environment. Every
subfolder contains a couple of key items:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>modules</code> folder containing all modules for that environment</li>
<li>A <code>manifests/site.pp</code> file containing the site.pp file for that environment</li>
<li>A new <code>environment.conf</code> file which can be used to set the <code>modulepath</code>, the <code>environment_timeout</code>, and, a new and often-requested feature, the ability to have environment-specific <code>config_version</code> settings</li>
</ul>


<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s everything that R10k ALREADY does with a couple of added goodies
dropped into an <code>environment.conf</code> file. <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments_configuring.html">Feel free to read the official docs
on configuring directory environments</a> for further information
on all of the goodies!</p>

<h2>Cool, how do we set it up?</h2>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be one of my blog posts if it didn&rsquo;t include exact steps to configure
shit, would it? For this walkthrough, I&rsquo;m using a Centos 6.5 vm with DNS working
(i.e. the node can ping itself and knows its own hostname and FQDN), and I&rsquo;ve
already installed an All-in-one installation of Puppet Enterprise 3.3.0. For
the walkthrough, we&rsquo;re going to setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directory environments based on a control repo</li>
<li>Hiera data inside a <code>hieradata</code> folder in the control repo</li>
<li>Hiera to use the per-environment hieradata folder</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s start to break down the components:</p>

<h3>The &lsquo;Control Repo&rsquo;?</h3>

<p>Sometime between <a href="http://bit.ly/puppetworkflows3">my initial R10k post</a> and THIS post, the Puppet Labs PS
team has come to call the repository that contains the Puppetfile and is used
to track Puppet environments on all Puppet masters the &lsquo;Control Repo&rsquo; (because
it &lsquo;Controls the creation of Puppet environments&rsquo;, ya dig?  Zack Smith and
James Sweeny are actually pretty tickled about making that name stick). For
the purpose of this demonstration, I&rsquo;m using a repository on Github:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository</a></p>

<p>Everything you will need for this walkthrough is in that repository, and we
will refer to it frequently. You DO NOT need to use my repository, and it&rsquo;s
definitely going to be required that you create your OWN, but it&rsquo;s there
for reference purposes (and to give you a couple of Puppet manifests to
make setup a bit easier).</p>

<h3>Configuring the Puppet master</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to first clone my control repo to <code>/tmp</code> so we can use it to
configure R10k and the Puppet master itself:</p>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>[root@master /tmp]# cd puppet_repository</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Great, I&rsquo;ve cloned my repo. To configure R10k, we&rsquo;re going to need to pull
down Zack Smith&rsquo;s R10k module from the forge with <code>puppet module install zack/r10k</code>
and then use <code>puppet apply</code> on a manifest in my repo with
<code>puppet apply configure_r10k.pp</code>.  <strong>DO NOTE: If you want to use YOUR Control
Repo, and NOT the one I use on Github, then you need to modify the
<code>configure_r10k.pp</code> file and replace the <code>remote</code> property with the URL to
YOUR Control Repo that&rsquo;s housed on a git repository!</strong></p>

<p>Performing those commands will successfully setup R10k to point to my Control
Repo out on Github (and, again, if you don&rsquo;t WANT that, then you need to make
the change to the <code>remote</code> property in <code>configure_r10k.pp</code>). We next need to
configure Directory Environments in <code>puppet.conf</code> by setting two attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>environmentpath</code> (Or the path to the folder containing environments)</li>
<li><code>basemodulepath</code> (Or, the set of modules that will be shared across ALL ENVIRONMENTS)</li>
</ul>


<p>I have created a Puppet manifest that will set these attributes, and this
manifest requires the <code>puppetlabs/inifile</code> module from the Puppet Forge.
Fortunately, since I&rsquo;m using Puppet Enterprise, that module is already installed.
If you&rsquo;re using open source Puppet and the module is NOT installed, feel free
to install it by running <code>puppet module install puppetlabs/inifile</code>. Once
this is done, go ahead and execute the manifest by running
<code>puppet apply configure_directory_environments.pp</code>:</p>

<p>The last step to configuring the Puppet master is to execute an R10k run.

<p>Great!  Everything should be setup (if you&rsquo;re using my repo)!  My repository has
a production branch, which is what Puppet&rsquo;s default environment is named,
so we can test that everything works by listing out all modules in the main
production environment with the <code>puppet module list</code> command:</p>

<p>Notice a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, I&rsquo;ve got some dependency issues&hellip;oh well, nothing that&rsquo;s a game-stopper</li>
<li>Second, the path to the production environment&rsquo;s module is correct at: <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>Configuring Hiera</h3>

<p>The last dinghy to be configured on this dreamboat is Hiera. Hiera is Puppet&rsquo;s
data lookup mechanism, and is used to gather specific bits of data (such
as versions of packages, hostnames, passwords, and other business-specific
data). Explaining HOW Hiera works is beyond the scope of this article, but
configuring Hiera data on a per-environment basis IS absolutely a worthwhile
endeavor.</p>

<p>In this example, I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate coupling Hiera data with the Control
Repo for simple replication of Hiera data across environments. You COULD also
choose to put your Hiera data in a separate repository and set it up in
<code>/etc/r10k.yaml</code> as another source, but that exercise is left to the reader
<a href="http://bit.ly/puppetworkflows3b">(and if you&rsquo;re interested, I talk about it in this post).</a></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that my demonstration repository ALREADY includes Hiera data,
and so that data is automatically being replicated to all environments. By
default, Hiera&rsquo;s configuration file (<code>hiera.yaml</code>) has no YAML data directory
specified, so we&rsquo;ll need to make that change.  <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository/blob/production/hiera.yaml">In my demonstration control
repository, I&rsquo;ve included a sample <code>hiera.yaml</code>,</a> but let&rsquo;s take a look at
one below:</p>

<p>This hiera.yaml file specifies a hierarchy with three levels &ndash; a node-specific,
level, a level for different application tiers (like &lsquo;dev&rsquo;, &lsquo;test&rsquo;, &lsquo;prod&rsquo;, and
etc), and finally makes the change we need: mapping the data directory to each
environment&rsquo;s hieradata folder.  The path to <code>hiera.yaml</code> is Puppet&rsquo;s
configuration directory (which is <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet</code> for Puppet
Enterprise, or <code>/etc/puppet</code> for the open source version of Puppet), so open
the file there, make your changes, and finally you&rsquo;ll need to need to restart
the Puppet master service to have the changes picked up.</p>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s perform a test by executing the <code>hiera</code> binary from the command
line before running puppet:</p>

<p>You can see that for the first example, I passed the environment of <code>production</code>
and did a simple lookup for a key called <code>message</code> &ndash; Hiera then returned me
the value of out that environment&rsquo;s <code>common.yaml</code> file.  Next, I did another
lookup, but added <code>-d</code> to enable debug mode (debug mode on the <code>hiera</code>
binary is REALLY handy for debugging problems with Hiera &ndash; combine it with
specifying values from the command line, and you can pretty quickly simulate
what value a node is going to get).  Notice the last example where I specified
an invalid environment &ndash; Hiera logged that it couldn&rsquo;t find the datafile
requested and ultimately returned a nil, or empty, value.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re working on the Puppet master machine, we can even check for a value
using <code>puppet apply</code> combined with the notice function:</p>

<p>Great, it&rsquo;s working, but let&rsquo;s look at pulling data from a higher level in the
hierarchy &ndash; like from the <code>application_tier</code> level. We haven&rsquo;t defined an
<code>application_tier</code> fact, however, so we&rsquo;ll need to fake it. First, let&rsquo;s do
that with the <code>hiera</code> binary:</p>

<h2>Tuning <code>environment.conf</code></h2>

<p>The brand-new, per-environment  <code>environment.conf</code> file is meant to be (for
the most part) a one-stop-shop for your Puppet environment tuning needs. Right
now, the only things you&rsquo;ll need to tune will be the <code>modulepath</code>,
<code>config_version</code>, and possibly the <code>environment_timeout</code>.</p>

<h3>Module path</h3>

<p>Before directory environments, every environment had its own <code>modulepath</code> that
needed to be tuned to allow for modules that were to be used by this
machine/environment, as well as shared modules.  That <code>modulepath</code> worked like
<code>$PATH</code> in that it was a priority-based lookup for modules (i.e. the first
directory in <code>modulepath</code> that had a module matching the module name you wanted
won).  It also previously required the FULL path to be used for every path in
<code>modulepath</code>.</p>

<p>Those days are over.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, the main <code>puppet.conf</code> configuration file has a new
parameter called <code>basemodulepath</code> that can be used to specify modules that are
to be shared across ALL modules in ALL environments. Paths defined here
(typically <code>$confdir/modules</code> and <code>/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</code>) are
usually put at the END of a <code>modulepath</code> so Puppet can search for any
overridden modules that show up in earlier <code>modulepath</code> paths. In the previous
configuration steps, we executed a manifest that setup <code>basemodulepath</code> to
look like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">basemodulepath = $confdir/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Again, feel free to add or remove paths (except don&rsquo;t remove
<code>/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</code> if you&rsquo;re using Puppet Enterprise, because
that&rsquo;s where all Puppet Enterprise modules are located), especially if you&rsquo;re
using a giant monolithic repo of modules (which was typically done before things
like R10k evolved).</p>

<p>With <code>basemodulepath</code> configured, it&rsquo;s now time to configure the <code>modulepath</code>
to be defined for every environment. My demonstration control repo contains
a sample <code>environment.conf</code> that defines a <code>modulepath</code> like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">modulepath = modules:$basemodulepath</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice, now, that there are relative paths in <code>modulepath</code>. This is
possible because now each environment contains an <code>environment.conf</code>, and thus
relative paths make sense. In this example, nodes in the production environment
(<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production</code>) will look for a module by its
name FIRST by looking in a folder called <code>modules</code> inside the current
environment folder (i.e. <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/modules/&lt;module_name&gt;</code>).
If the module wasn&rsquo;t found there, it looks for the module in the order that
paths are defined for <code>basemodulepath</code> above. If Puppet fails to find a module
in ANY of the paths, a compile error is raised.</p>

<h3>Per-environment <code>config_version</code></h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/stable/configuration.html#configversion">Setting <code>config_version</code> has been around for awhile</a> &ndash; hell,
I remember video of Jeff McCune talking about it at the first Puppetcamp Europe
in like 2010 &ndash; but the new directory environments implementation has fine
tuned it a bit. Previously, <code>config_version</code> was a command executed on the
Puppet master at compile time to determine a string used for versioning the
configuration enforced during that Puppet run. When it&rsquo;s not set it defaults
to something of a time/date stamp off the parser, but it&rsquo;s way more useful to
make it do something like determine the most recent commit hash from a repository.</p>

<p>In the past when we used a giant monolithic repository containing all Puppet
modules, it was SUPER easy to get a single commit hash and be done. As everyone
moved their modules into individual repositories, determining <em>WHAT</em> you were
enforcing became harder. With the birth of R10k an the control repo, we
suddenly had something we could query for the state of our modules being
enforced. The problem existed, though, that with multiple dynamic environments
using multiple git branches, <code>config_version</code> wasn&rsquo;t easily tuned to be able
to grab the most recent commit from every branch.</p>

<p>Now that <code>config_version</code> is set in a per-environment <code>environment.conf</code>, we
can make <code>config_version</code> much smarter. Again, looking in the <code>environment.conf</code>
defined in my demonstration control repo produces this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">config_version = &#39;/usr/bin/git --git-dir $confdir/environments/$environment/.git rev-parse HEAD&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This setting will cause the Puppet master to produce the most recent commit ID
for whatever environment you&rsquo;re in and embed it in the catalog and the report
that is sent back to the Puppet master after a Puppet run.</p>

<p><a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-3150">I actually discovered a bug in <code>config_version</code> while writing this post</a>,
and it&rsquo;s that <code>config_version</code> is subject to the relative pathing fun that other
<code>environment.conf</code> settings are subject to. Relative pathing is great for things like
<code>modulepath</code>, and it&rsquo;s even good for <code>config_version</code> if you&rsquo;re including the
script you want to run to gather the <code>config_version</code> string inside the control
repo, but using a one-line command that tries to execute a binary on the system
that DOESN&rsquo;T include the full path to the binary causes an error (because Puppet
attempts to look for that binary in the current environment path, and NOT by
searching <code>$PATH</code> on the system).  Feel free to follow or comment on the bug
if the mood hits you.</p>

<h3>Caching and environment_timeout</h3>

<p>The Puppet master loads environments on-request, but it also caches data associated
with each environment to make things faster. This caching is finally tunable on a
per-environment basis by defining the <code>environment_timeout</code> setting in
<code>environment.conf</code>.  The default setting is 3 minutes, which means the Puppet master
will invalidate its caches and reload environment data every 3 minutes, but that&rsquo;s
now tunable. <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3.6/reference/environments_configuring.html#environmenttimeout">Definitely read up on this setting before making changes.</a></p>

<h2>Classification</h2>

<p>One of the last new features of directory environments is the ability to include
an environment-specific <code>site.pp</code> file for classification. You could ALWAYS do
this by modifying the <code>manifest</code> configuration item in <code>puppet.conf</code>, but now
each environment can have its own <code>manifest</code> setting. The default behavior is
to have the Puppet master look for <code>manifests/site.pp</code> in every environment
directory, and I really wouldn&rsquo;t change that unless you have a good reason. DO
NOTE, however, that if you&rsquo;re using Puppet Enterprise, you&rsquo;ll need to be careful
with your <code>site.pp</code> file.  Puppet Enterprise defines things like the Filebucket
and overrides for the File resource in <code>site.pp</code>, so if you&rsquo;re using Puppet Enterprise,
you&rsquo;ll need to copy those changes into the <code>site.pp</code> file you add into your control
repo (as I did).</p>

<p>It may take you a couple of times to change your thinking from looking at the main
<code>site.pp</code> in <code>$confdir/manifests</code> to looking at each environment-specific <code>site.pp</code>
file, but definitely take advantage of Puppet&rsquo;s commandline tool to help you track
which <code>site.pp</code> Puppet is monitoring:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">root@master /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments</span><span class="p-Indicator">]</span><span class="c1"># puppet config print manifest</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production/manifests</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">[root@master /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments]# puppet config print manifest --environment webinar_env</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/webinar_env/manifests</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can see that <code>puppet config print</code> can be used to get the path to the
directory that contains <code>site.pp</code>.  Even cooler is what happens when you
specify an environment that doesn&rsquo;t exist:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">root@master /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments</span><span class="p-Indicator">]</span><span class="c1"># puppet config print manifest --environment bad_env</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">no_manifest</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yep, Puppet tells you if it can&rsquo;t find the manifest file.  That&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Even though the new implementation of directory environments is meant to map
closely to a workflow most of us have been using (if you&rsquo;ve been using R10k, that is),
there are still some new features that may take you by surprise. Hopefully this
post gets you started with just enough information to setup your own test
environment and start playing. PLEASE DO make sure to file bugs on any behavior
that comes as unexpected or stops you from using your existing workflow. Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been more than a couple of moments where I&rsquo;m on-site with a customer
who asks a seemingly simple question and I&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;Oh shit; that&rsquo;s a great
question and I&rsquo;ve never thought of that&hellip;&rdquo;  Usually that&rsquo;s followed by me
changing up the workflow and immediately regretting things I&rsquo;ve done on prior
gigs. Some people call that &lsquo;agile&rsquo;; I call it &lsquo;me not having the
forethought to consider conditions properly&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>&lsquo;Environment&rsquo;, like &lsquo;scaling&rsquo;, &lsquo;agent&rsquo;, and &lsquo;test&rsquo;, has many meanings</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a secret that we&rsquo;ve made some shitty decisions in the past with regard
to naming things in Puppet (and anyone who asks me what <code>puppet agent -t</code>
stands for usually gets a heavy sigh, a shaken head, and an explanation emitted
in dulcet, apologetic tones). It&rsquo;s also very easy to conflate certain concepts
that unfortunately share very common labels (quick &ndash; what&rsquo;s the difference
between properties and parameters, and give me the lowdown on MCollective
agents versus Puppet agents!).</p>

<p>And then we have &lsquo;environments&rsquo; + Hiera + R10k.</p>

<h3>Puppet &lsquo;environments&rsquo;</h3>

<p>Puppet has the concept of &lsquo;environments&rsquo;, which, to me, exist to provide a
means of compiling a catalog using different paths to Puppet modules on the
Puppet master. Using a Puppet environment is the same as saying &ldquo;I made some
changes to my tomcat class, but I don&rsquo;t want to push it DIRECTLY to my production
machines yet because I don&rsquo;t drink Dos Equis. It would be great if I could stick
this code somewhere and have a couple of my nodes test how it works before
merging it in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puppet environments suffer some &lsquo;seepage&rsquo; issues,
<a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/12173">which you can read about here,</a> but do a reasonable job of quickly
testing out changes you&rsquo;ve made to the Puppet DSL (as opposed to custom
plugins, as detailed in the bug). Puppet environments work well when you
need a pipeline for testing your Puppet code (again, when you&rsquo;re refactoring
or adding new functionality), and using them for that purpose is great.</p>

<h3>Internal &lsquo;environments&rsquo;</h3>

<p>What I consider &lsquo;internal environments&rsquo; have a couple of names &ndash; sometimes
they&rsquo;re referred to as application or deployment gateways, sometimes as &lsquo;tiers&rsquo;, but
in general they&rsquo;re long-term groupings that machines/nodes are attached to
(usually for the purpose of phased-out application deployments). They
frequently have names such as &lsquo;dev&rsquo;, &lsquo;test&rsquo;, &lsquo;prod&rsquo;, &lsquo;qa&rsquo;, &lsquo;uat&rsquo;, and the
like.</p>

<p>For the purpose of distinguishing them from Puppet environments, I&rsquo;m going to
refer to them as &lsquo;application tiers&rsquo; or just &lsquo;tiers&rsquo; because, fuck it, it&rsquo;s a
word.</p>

<h3>Making both of them work</h3>

<p>The problems with having Puppet environments and application tiers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Puppet environments are usually assigned to a node for short periods of time,
while application tiers are usually assigned to a node for the life of the node.</li>
<li>Application tiers usually need different bits of data (i.e. NTP server
addresses, versions of packages, etc), while Puppet environments usually
use/involve differences to the Puppet DSL.</li>
<li>Similarly to the first point, the goal of Puppet environments is to eventually
merge code differences into the main production Puppet environment. Application
tiers, however, may always have differences about them and never become unified.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can see where this would be problematic &ndash; especially when you might want to
do things like use different Hiera values between different application tiers,
but you want to TEST out those values before applying them to all nodes in an
application tier. If you previously didn&rsquo;t have a way to separate Puppet
environments from application tiers, and you used R10k to generate Puppet
environments, you would have things like long-term branches in your repositories
that would make it difficult/annoying to manage.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: This is all assuming you&rsquo;re managing component modules, Hiera data,
and Puppet environments using R10k.</strong></p>

<p>The first step in making both monikers work together is to have two separate
variables in Puppet &ndash; namely <code>$environment</code> for Puppet environments, and
something ELSE (say, <code>$tier</code>) for the application tier. The &ldquo;something else&rdquo; is
going to depend on how your workflow works. For example, do you have something
centrally that can correlate nodes to the tier in which they belong? If so, you
can write a custom fact that will query that service. If you don&rsquo;t have this
magical service, you can always just attach an application tier to a node in
your classification service (i.e. the Puppet Enterprise Console or Foreman).
Failing both of those, <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/custom_facts.html#external-facts">you can look to external facts.</a> External Fact
support was introduced into Facter 1.7 (but Puppet Enterprise has supported
them through the standard lib for quite awhile). External facts give you the
ability to create a text file inside the facts.d directory in the format of:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>tier=qa
</span><span class='line'>location=portland</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Facter will read this text file and store the values as facts for a Puppet run,
so <code>$tier</code> will be <code>qa</code> and <code>$location</code> will be <code>portland</code>. This is handy for
when you have arbitrary information that can&rsquo;t be easily discovered by the
node, but DOES need to be assigned for the node on a reasonably consistent
basis.  Usually these files are created during the provisioning process, but
can also be managed by Puppet.  At any rate, having <code>$environment</code> and <code>$tier</code>
available allow us to start to make decisions based on the values.</p>

<h3>Branch with $environment, Hiera with $tier</h3>

<p>Like we said above, Puppet environments are frequently short-term assignments,
while application tiers are usually long-term residencies. Relating those back
to the R10k workflow: branches to the main puppet repo (containing the
<code>Puppetfile</code>) are usually short-lived, while data in Hiera is usually
longer-lived. It would then make sense that the name of the branches to the
main puppet repo would resolve to being <code>$environment</code> (and thus the Puppet
environment name), and <code>$tier</code> (and thus the application tier) would be used
in the Hiera hierarchy for lookups of values that would remain different across
application tiers (like package versions, credentials, and etc&hellip;).</p>

<p>Wins:</p>

<ul>
<li>Puppet environment names (like repository branch names) become relatively
meaningless and are the &ldquo;means&rdquo; to the end of getting Puppet code merged into
the PUPPET CODE&rsquo;s production branch (i.e. code that has been tested to work
across all application tiers)</li>
<li>Puppet environments become short lived and thus have less opportunity to
deviate from the main production codebase</li>
<li>Differences across application tiers are locked in one place (Hiera)</li>
<li>Differences to Puppet DSL code (i.e. in Manifests) can be pushed up to the
profile level, and you have a fact (<code>$tier</code>) to catch those differences.</li>
</ul>


<p>The ultimate reason why I&rsquo;m writing about this is because I&rsquo;ve seen people try
to incorporate both the Puppet environment and application tier into both the
environment name and/or the Hiera hierarchy. Many times, they run into all
kinds of unscalable issues (large hierarchies, many Puppet environments,
confusing testing paths to &lsquo;production&rsquo;). I tend to prefer this workflow
choice, but, like everything I write about, take it and model it toward what
works for you (because what works now may not work 6 months from now).</p>

<h2>Thoughts?</h2>

<p>Like I said before, I tend to discover new corner cases that change my mind
on things like this, so it&rsquo;s quite possible that this theory isn&rsquo;t the most
solid in the world. It HAS helped out some customers to clean up their code
and make for a cleaner pipeline, though, and that&rsquo;s always a good thing. Feel
free to comment below &ndash; I look forward to making the process better for all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/18/puppet-workflow-part-3/">In the last workflows post,</a> I talked about dynamic Puppet
environments and introduced R10k, which is an awesome tool for mapping modules
to their environments which are dynamically generated by git branches. I didn&rsquo;t
get out everything I wanted to say because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was tired of that post sitting stale in a Google Doc</li>
<li>It was already goddamn long</li>
</ul>


<p>So because of that, consider this a continuation of that previous monstrosity
that talks about additional uses of R10k beyond the ordinary</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s talk Hiera</h2>

<p>But seriously, let&rsquo;s not actually talk about what Hiera does since
<a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/complete_example.html">there are better docs</a> out there for that. I&rsquo;m
also not going to talk about WHEN to use Hiera because
<a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/12/08/when-to-hiera/">I&rsquo;ve already done that before.</a> Instead, let&rsquo;s talk about a workflow
for submitting changes to Hiera data and testing it out before it enters into
production.</p>

<p>Most people store their Hiera data (if they&rsquo;re using a backend that reads Hiera
data from disk anyways) in separate repos as their Puppet repo. Some DO tie the
Hiera datadir folder to something like the main Puppet repo that houses their
<code>Puppetfie</code> (if they&rsquo;re using R10k), but for the most part it&rsquo;s a separate
repo because you may want separate permissions for accessing that data.
For the purposes of this post, I&rsquo;m going to refer to
<a href="https://github.com/glarizza/hiera_environment">a repository I use for storing Hiera data</a> that&rsquo;s out on Github.</p>

<p>The next logical step would be to integrate that Hiera repo into R10k so R10k can
track and create paths for Hiera data just like it did for Puppet.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Fundamentally, all that R10k does is checkout modules to a specific
path whose folder name comes from a git branch. PUPPET ties its environment
to this folder name with some <code>puppet.conf</code> trickery. So, to say that R10k
&ldquo;creates dynamic environments&rdquo; is the end-result, but not the actual job
of the tool.</strong></p>

<p>We COULD add Hiera&rsquo;s repository to the <code>/etc/r10k.yaml</code> file to track and
create folders for us, and if we did it EXACTLY like we did for Puppet we
would most definitely run into <a href="https://github.com/adrienthebo/r10k/issues/48">this R10k bug</a> (AND,
<a href="https://github.com/adrienthebo/r10k/issues/90">it comes up again in this bug</a>).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: So, I originally wrote this post BEFORE R10k version 1.1.4 was
released. Finch released version 1.1.4 which FIXES THESE BUGS&hellip;so the workflow
I&rsquo;m going to describe (i.e. using prefixing to solve the problem of using
multiple repos in <code>/etc/r10k.yaml</code> that could possibly share branch names)
TECHNICALLY does NOT need to be followed &lsquo;to the T&rsquo;, as it were. You can
disable prefixing when it comes to that step, and modify
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml</code> so you don&rsquo;t prepend &lsquo;hiera_&rsquo; to the
path of each environment&rsquo;s folder, and you should be totally fine&hellip;you know,
as long as you use version 1.1.4 or greater of R10k.  So, be forewarned</strong></p>

<p>The issue is those bugs is that R10k collects the names of ALL the environments
from ALL the sources at once, so if you have multiple source repositories and
they share branch names, then you have clashes (since it only stores ONE branch
name internally). The solution that Finch came up with was prefixing (or,
prefixing the name of the branch with the name of the source). When you prefix,
however, it creates a folder on-disk that matches the prefixed name (e.g.
NameOfTheSource_NameOfTheBranch ). This is actually fine since we&rsquo;ll catch it
and deal with it, but you should be aware of it. Future versions of R10k may
most likely deal with this in a different manner, so make sure to check out the
R10k docs before blindly copying my code, okay? (Update: See the previous, bolded
paragraph where I describe how Finch DID JUST THAT).</p>

<p><a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/18/puppet-workflow-part-3/">In the previous post</a> I setup a file called <code>r10k_installation.pp</code>
to setup R10k. Let&rsquo;s revisit that manifest it and modify it for

<p><strong>NOTE: For the duration of this post, I&rsquo;ll be referring to Puppet Enterprise
specific paths (like <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet</code> for $confdir). Please do the
translation for open source Puppet, as R10k will work just fine with either
the open source edition or the Enterprise edition of Puppet</strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll note that I added a source called &lsquo;hiera&rsquo; that tracks my Hiera
repository, creates sub-folders in <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera</code>, and enables
prefixing to deal with the bug I mentioned in the previous paragraph. Now,
let&rsquo;s run Puppet and do an R10k synchronization:</p>

<p>Great, so it configured R10k to clone the Hiera repository to
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera</code> like we wanted it to, and you can see that with
prefixing enabled we have folders named &ldquo;hiera_${branchname}&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In Puppet, the magical connection that maps these subfolders to Puppet
environments is in <code>puppet.conf</code>, but for Hiera that&rsquo;s the <code>hiera.yaml</code> file.
I&rsquo;ve included that file in my <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/hiera_environment">Hiera repo</a>, so let&rsquo;s look at the
copy at <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera/hiera_production/hiera.yaml</code>:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The magical line is in the <code>:datadir:</code> setting of the <code>:yaml:</code> section; it
uses <code>%{environment}</code> to evaluate the environment variable set by Puppet and
set the path accordingly.</p>

<p>As of right now R10k is configured to clone Hiera data from a known repository
to <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera</code>, to create sub-folders based on branches to
that repository, and to tie data provided to each Puppet environment to the
respective subfolder of <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera</code> that matches the pattern
of <strong>&ldquo;hiera_(environment_name)&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<h3>The problem with <code>hiera.yaml</code></h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that each subfolder to <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera</code> contains
its own copy of <code>hiera.yaml</code>.  You&rsquo;re probably drawing the conclusion that
each Puppet environment can read from its own <code>hiera.yaml</code> for Hiera configuration.</p>

<p>And you would be wrong.</p>

<p><a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/11784">For information on this bug, check out this link.</a> You&rsquo;ll see
that we provide a &lsquo;hiera_config&rsquo; configuration option in Puppet that allows
you to specify the path to <code>hiera.yaml</code>, but Puppet loads that config as
singleton, which means that it&rsquo;s read initially when the Puppet master process
starts up and it&rsquo;s NOT environment-aware. The workaround is to use one
<code>hiera.yaml</code> for all environments on a Puppet master but to dynamically change
the <code>:datadir:</code> path according to the current environment (in the same way that
dynamic Puppet environments abuse &lsquo;$environment&rsquo; in <code>puppet.conf</code>). You gain
the ability to have per-environment changes to Hiera data but lose the ability
to do things like using different hierarchies for different environments. As
of right now, if you want a different hierarchy then you&rsquo;re going to need to
use a different master (or do some hacky things that I don&rsquo;t even want to
BEGIN to approach in this article).</p>

<p>In summary &ndash; there will be a hiera.yaml per environment, but they will not
be consulted on a per-environment basis.</p>

<h3>Workflow for per-environment Hiera data</h3>

<p><a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/18/puppet-workflow-part-3/">Looking back on the previous post,</a> you&rsquo;ll see that the workflow
for updating Hiera data is identical to the workflow for updating code to your
Puppet environments.  Namely, to create a new environment for testing Hiera
data, you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push a branch to the Hiera repository and name it accordingly (remembering
that the name you choose will be a new environment).</li>
<li>Run R10k to synchronize the data down to the Puppet master</li>
<li>Add your node to that environment and test out the changes</li>
</ul>


<p>For existing environments, simply push changes to that environment&rsquo;s branch
and repeat the last two steps.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Puppet environments and Hiera environments are linked &ndash; both tools use
the same &lsquo;environment&rsquo; concept and so environment names MUST match for the data
to be shared (i.e. if you create an environment in Puppet called &lsquo;yellow&rsquo;, you
will need a Hiera environment called &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; for that data).</strong></p>

<p>This tight-coupling can cause issues, and will ultimately mean that certain
branches are longer-lived than others. It&rsquo;s also the reason why I don&rsquo;t use
defaults in my <code>hiera()</code> lookups inside Puppet manifests &ndash; I WANT the early
failure of a compilation error to alert me of something that needs fixed.</p>

<p>You will need to determine whether this tight-coupling is worth it for your
organization to tie your Hiera repository directly into R10k or to handle it
out-of-band.</p>

<h2>R10k and monolithic module repositories</h2>

<p>One of the first requirements you encounter when working with R10k is that your
component modules need to be stored in their own repositories.  That convention
is still relatively new &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that we were recommending that
modules be locked away in a giant repo. Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s easier to clone</li>
<li>The state of module reusability was poor</li>
</ul>


<p>The main reason was that it was easier to put everything in one repo and clone
it out on all your Puppet master servers. This becomes insidious as your module
count rises and people start doing lovely things like committing large binaries
into modules, pulling in old versions of modules they find out on the web, and
the like. It also becomes an issue when you start needing to lock committers
out of specific directories due to sensitive data, and blah blah blah blah&hellip;</p>

<p>There are better posts out there justifying/villafying the choice of one or
multiple repositories, this section&rsquo;s meant only to show you how to incorporate
a single repository containing multiple modules into your R10k workflow.</p>

<p><a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/18/puppet-workflow-part-3/">From the last post</a> you&rsquo;ll remember that the <code>Puppetfile</code> allows
you to tie a repository, and some version reference, to a directory using
R10k. Incorporating a monolithic repository starts with an entry in the
<code>Puppetfile</code> like so:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: That git repository doesn&rsquo;t exist. I don&rsquo;t HAVE a monolithic repo to
demonstrate, so I&rsquo;ve chosen an arbitrary URI. Also note that you can use ANY
name you like after the <code>mod</code> syntax to name the resultant folder &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t
HAVE to mirror the URI of the repository.</strong></p>

<p>Adding this entry to the <code>Puppetfile</code> would checkout that repository to
wherever all the other modules are checked out with a folder name of
&lsquo;my_big_module_repo&rsquo;. Within that folder would most-likely (again, depending
on how you&rsquo;ve laid out your repository) contain subfolders containing Puppet
modules. This entry gets the modules onto your Puppet master, but it doesn&rsquo;t
make Puppet aware of their location. For that, we&rsquo;re going to need to add an
entry to the &lsquo;modulepath&rsquo; configuration item in <code>puppet.conf</code></p>

<p>Inside <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf</code> you should see a configuration item
called &lsquo;modulepath&rsquo; that currently has a value of:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>modulepath = /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/$environment/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The modulepath itself works like a PATH environment variable in Linux &ndash; it&rsquo;s
a priority-based lookup mechanism that Puppet uses to find modules. Currently,
Puppet will first look in <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/$environment/modules</code>
for a module. If a the module that Puppet was looking for was found, Puppet
will use it and not inspect the second path. If the module was not found at the
FIRST path, it will inspect the second path. Failing to find the module at the
second path results in a compilation error for Puppet. Using this to our
advantage, we can add the path to the monolithic repository checked-out by the
<code>Puppetfile</code> AFTER the path to where all the individual modules are checked-out.
This should look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>modulepath = /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/$environment/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/$environment/modules/my_big_module_repo:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Note: This assumes all modules are in the root of the monolithic repo. If
they&rsquo;re in a subdirectory, you must adjust accordingly</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a huge line (and if you&rsquo;re afraid of anything over 80 column-widths then
I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;and you should probably buy a new monitor&hellip;and the 80s are over),
but the gist is that we&rsquo;re first going to look for modules checked out by R10k,
THEN we&rsquo;re going to look for modules in our monolithic repo, then we&rsquo;re going
to look in Puppet Enterprise&rsquo;s vendored module directory, and finally, like I
said above, we&rsquo;ll fail if we can&rsquo;t find our module. This will allow you to KEEP
using your monolithic repository and also slowly cut modules inside that
monolithic repo over to their own repositories (since when they gain their own
repository, they will be located in a path that COMES before the monolithic
repo, and thus will be given priority).</p>

<h2>Using MCollective to perform R10k synchronizations</h2>

<p>This section is going to be much less specific than the rest because the piece
that does the ACTION is part of <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/zack/r10k">a module for R10k</a>. As of the time
of this writing, this agent is in one state, but that could EASILY change. I
will defer to <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/zack/r10k">the module in question</a> (and specifically its
README file) should you need specifics (or if my module is dated). What I CAN
tell you, however, is that <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/zack/r10k">the R10k module</a> does come with a class
that will setup and configure both an MCollective agent for R10k and also a
helper application that should make doing R10k synchroniations on multiple
Puppet masters much easier than doing them by hand.  First, you&rsquo;ll need to
INSTALL the MCollective agent/application, and you can do that by pulling
down <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/zack/r10k">the module</a> and its dependencies, and classifying all Puppet
masters with R10k enabled by doing the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='puppet'><span class='line'><span class="kn">include</span> <span class="nc">r10k::mcollective</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Terribly difficult, huh? With that, both the MCollective agent and application
should be available to MCollective on that node. The way to trigger a
syncronization is to login to an account on a machine that has MCollective
client access (in Puppet Enterprise, this would be any Puppet master that&rsquo;s
allowed the role, and then, specifically, the <code>peadmin</code> user&hellip;so doing a
<code>su - peadmin</code> should afford you access to that user), and perform the following
command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='puppet'><span class='line'><span class="err">mco</span> <span class="err">r10k</span> <span class="err">deploy</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is where the README differs a bit, and the reason for that is because Finch
changed the syntax that R10k uses to synchronize and deploy modules to a Master.
The CURRENTLY accepted command (because, knowing Finch, that shit might change)
is <code>r10k deploy environment -p</code>, and the action to the MCollective agent that
EXECUTES that command is the &lsquo;deploy&rsquo; action.  The README refers to the
&lsquo;synchronize&rsquo; action, which executes the <code>r10k synchronize</code> command. This command
MAY STILL WORK, but it&rsquo;s deprecated, and so it&rsquo;s NOT recommended to be used.</p>

<p>Like I said before, this agent is subject to change (mainly do to R10k command
deprecation and maturation), so definitely refer to the README and the code
itself for more information (or
<a href="http://github.com/acidprime/puppet-r10k">file issues and pull requests on the module repo directly</a>).</p>

<h2>Tying R10k to CI workflows</h2>

<p>I spent a year doing some presales work for the Puppet Labs SE team, so I can
hand-wave and tapdance like a motherfucker. I&rsquo;m going to need those skills for
this next section, because if you thought the previous section glossed over the
concepts pretty quickly and without much detail, then this section is going to
feel downright vaporous (is that a word? Fuck it; I&rsquo;m handwaving &ndash; it&rsquo;s
a word). I really debated whether to include the following sections in this
post because I don&rsquo;t really give you much specific information; it&rsquo;s all very
generic and full of &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; (though I do list some testing libraries below that
are helpful if you&rsquo;ve never heard of them). Feel free to abandon ship and skip
to the FINAL section right now if you don&rsquo;t want to hear about &lsquo;ideas&rsquo;.</p>

<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m going to just pick and use the term &ldquo;CI&rdquo; when I&rsquo;m referring
to the process of automating the testing and deployment of, in this case,
Puppet code.  There have definitely been posts arging about which definition is
more appropriate, but, frankly, I&rsquo;m just going to pick a term and go with it,</p>

<p>The issue at hand is that when you talk &ldquo;CI&rdquo; or &ldquo;CD&rdquo; or &ldquo;Continuous (fill_in_the_blank)&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re
talking about a workflow that&rsquo;s tailored to each organization (and sometimes
each DEPARTMENT of an organization). Sometimes places can agree on a specific
tool to assist them with this process (be it Jenkins, Hudson, Bamboo, or
whatever), but beyond that it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re talking PUPPET code, though, you&rsquo;re restricted to certain tasks
that will show up in any workflow&hellip;and THAT is what I want to talk about here.</p>

<p>To implement some sort of CI workflow means laying down a &lsquo;pipeline&rsquo; that takes a
change of your Puppet code (a new module, a change to an existing module, some
Hiera data updates, whatever) from the developer&rsquo;s/operations engineer&rsquo;s workstation
right into production.  The way we do this with R10k currently is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a change to an individual module</li>
<li>Commit/push those changes to the module&rsquo;s remote repository</li>
<li>Create a test branch of the puppet_repository</li>
<li>Modify the <code>Puppetfile</code> and tie your module&rsquo;s changes to this environment</li>
<li>Commit/push those changes to the puppet_repository</li>
<li>Perform an R10k synchronization</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-7 as necessary until shit works how you like it</li>
<li>Merge the changes in the test branch of the puppet_repository with the production branch</li>
<li>Perform an R10k synchronization</li>
<li>Watch code changes become active in your production environment</li>
</ul>


<p>Of those steps, there&rsquo;s arguably about 3 unique steps that could be automated:</p>

<ul>
<li>R10k synchronizations</li>
<li>&lsquo;Testing&rsquo; (whatever that means)</li>
<li>Merging the changes in the test branch of the puppet_repository with the production branch</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>NOTE: As we get progressively-more-handwavey (also probably not a word, but fuck it &ndash; let&rsquo;s
be thought leaders and CREATE IT), each one of these steps is going to be more
and more&hellip;generic. For example &ndash; to say &ldquo;test your code&rdquo; is a great idea, but,
seriously, defining how to do that could (and should) be multiple blog posts.</strong></p>

<h3>Laying down the pipeline</h3>

<p>If I were building an automated workflow, the first thing I would do is
setup something like Jenkins and configure it to watch the puppet_repository
that contains the <code>Puppetfile</code> mapping all my modules and versions to Puppet
environments. On changes to this repository, we want Jenkins to perform an R10k
synchronization, run tests, and then, possibly, merge those changes into
production (depending on the quality of your tests and how &lsquo;webscale&rsquo; you think
you are on that day).</p>

<h3>R10k synchronizations</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re paying attention, we solved this problem in the previous section with
the R10k MCollective agent. Jenkins should be running on a machine that has the
ability to execute MCollective client commands (such as triggering
<code>mco r10k deploy</code> when necessary).  You&rsquo;ll want to tailor your calls from
Jenkins to only deploy environments it&rsquo;s currently testing (remember in the
puppet_repository that topic branches map to Puppet environments, so this
is a per-branch action) as opposed to deploying ALL environments every time.</p>

<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re buiding a pipeline, you might not want to do R10k
synchronizations on ALL of your Puppet Masters at this point. Why not? Well,
if your testing framework is good enough and has sufficient coverage that
you&rsquo;re COMPLETELY trusting it to determine whether code is acceptable or not,
then this is just the FIRST step &ndash; making the code available to be tested. It&rsquo;s
not passed tests yet, so pushing it out to all of your Puppet masters is a bit
wasteful. You&rsquo;ll probably want to only synchronize with a single master that&rsquo;s
been identified for testing (and a master that has the ability to spin up
fresh nodes, enforce the Puppet code on them, submit those nodes to a battery
of tests, and then tear them down when everything has been completed).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like the VAST majority of Puppet users out there that DON&rsquo;T have a
completely automated testing framework that has such complete coverage that you
trust it to determine whether code changes are acceptable or not, then you&rsquo;re
probably &lsquo;testing&rsquo; changes manually. For these people, you&rsquo;ll probably want to
synchronize code to whichever Puppet master(s) are suitable.</p>

<p>The cool thing about these scenarios is that MCollective is flexible enough
to handle this. MCollective has the ability to filter your nodes based on
things like available MCollective agents, Facter facts, Puppet classes, and
even things like the MD5 hashes of arbitrary files on the filesystem&hellip;so
however you want to restrict synchronization, you can do it with MCollective.</p>

<p>After all of that, the answer here is &ldquo;Use MCollective to do R10k syncs/deploys.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>This section needs its own subset of blog posts. There are all kinds of tools
that will allow you to test all sorts of things about your Puppet code (from
basic syntax checking and linting, to integration tests that check for the
presence of resources in the catalog, to acceptance-level tests that check
the end-state of the system to make sure Puppet left it in a state that&rsquo;s
acceptable).  The most common tools for these types of tests are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://puppet-lint.com">Puppet-lint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rspec-puppet.com">Rspec-puppet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker">Beaker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec">Serverspec</a></li>
<li>And more&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately, the point of this section is NOT to walk you through setting up
one or more of those tools (I&rsquo;d love to write those posts soon&hellip;), but rather
to make you aware of their presence and identify where they fit in our Pipeline.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve synchronized/deployed code changes to a specific machine (or
subset of machines), the next step is to trigger tests.</p>

<p>Backing up the train a bit, certain kinds of &lsquo;tests&rsquo; should be done WELL in
advance of this step. For example, if code changes don&rsquo;t even pass basic syntax
checking and linting, they shouldn&rsquo;t even MAKE it into your repository. Things
like pre-commit hooks will allow you to trigger syntactical checks and linting
before a commit is allowed. We&rsquo;re assuming you&rsquo;ve already set those up (and
if you&rsquo;ve NOT, then you should probably do that RIGHT NOW).</p>

<p>Rather, in this section, we&rsquo;re talking about doing some basic integration
smoke testing (i.e. running the rspec-puppet tests on all the modules to ensure
that what we EXPECT in the catalog is actually IN the catalog), moving into
acceptance level testing (i.e. spinning up pristine/clean nodes, actually
applying the Puppet code to the nodes, and then running things like Beaker
or Serverspec on the nodes to check the end-state of things like services, open
ports, configuration files, and whatever to ensure that Puppet ACTUALLY left
the system in a workable state), and then returning a &ldquo;PASS&rdquo; or
&ldquo;FAIL&rdquo; response to Jenkins (or whatever is controlling your pipeline).</p>

<p>These tests can be as thorough or as loose as is acceptable to you (obviously,
the goal is to automate ALL of your tests so you don&rsquo;t have to manually check
ANY changes, but that&rsquo;s the nerd-nirvana state where we&rsquo;re all browsing the web
all day), but they should catch the most NOTORIOUS and OBVIOUS things FIRST.
Follow the same rules you did when you got started with Puppet &ndash; catch the
things that are easiest to catch and start building up your cache of &ldquo;Total
Time Saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jenkins needs to be able to trigger these tests from wherever it&rsquo;s running,
so your Jenkins box needs the ability to, say, spin up nodes in ESX, or
locally with something like Vagrant, or even cloud nodes in EC2 or GCE, then
TRIGGER the tests, and finally get a &ldquo;PASS&rdquo; or &ldquo;FAIL&rdquo; response back. The
HARDEST part here, by far, is that you have to define what level of testing
you&rsquo;re going to implement, how you&rsquo;re going to implement it, and devise
the actual process to perform the testing. Like I said before, there are other
blog posts that talk about this (and I hope to tackle this topic in the very
near future), so I&rsquo;ll leave it to them for the moment.</p>

<h3>To merge or not to merge</h3>

<p>The final step for any test code is to determine whether it should be merged
into production or not. Like I said before, if your tests are sufficient and
are adequate at determining whether a change is &lsquo;good&rsquo; or not, then you can
look at automating the process of merging those changes into production and
killing off the test branch (or, NOT merging those changes, and leaving the
branch open for more changes).</p>

<p>Automatically merging is scary for obvious reasons, but it&rsquo;s also a good &lsquo;test&rsquo;
for your test coverage. Committing to a &lsquo;merge upon success&rsquo; workflow takes
trust, and there&rsquo;s absolutely no shame in leaving this step to a human,
to a change review board, or to some out-of-band process.</p>

<h2>Use your illusion</h2>

<p>These are the most common questions I get asked after the initial shock of R10k,
and its workflow, wears off. Understand that I do these posts NOT from a &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
what you should absolutely be doing!&rdquo; standpoint, but more from a &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
going on out there.&rdquo; vantage. Every time I&rsquo;m called on-site with a customer, I
evaluate:</p>

<ul>
<li>The size and experience level of the team involved</li>
<li>The processes that the team must adhere to</li>
<li>The Puppet experience level of the team</li>
<li>The goals of the team</li>
</ul>


<p>Frankly, after all those observations, sometimes I ABSOLUTELY come to the
conclusion that something like R10k is entirely-too-much process for
not-enough benefit. For those who are a fit, though, we go down the checklists
and tailor the workflow to the environment.</p>

<h2>What more IS there on R10k?</h2>

<p>I do have at least a couple of more posts in me on some specific issues I&rsquo;ve
hit when consulting with companies using R10k, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>How best to use Hiera and R10k with Puppet &lsquo;environments&rsquo; and internal, long-term &lsquo;environments&rsquo;</li>
<li>Better ideas on &lsquo;what to branch and why&rsquo; with regard to component modules and the puppet_repository</li>
<li>To inherit or not to inherit with Roles</li>
<li>How to name things (note that I work for Puppet Labs, so I&rsquo;m most likely very WRONG with this section)</li>
<li>Other random things I&rsquo;ve noticed&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, I apologize if it&rsquo;s been awhile since I&rsquo;ve replied to a couple of
comments. I&rsquo;m booked out 3 months in advance and things are pretty wild at
the moment, but I&rsquo;m REALLY thankful of everyone who cares enough to drop a
note, and I hope I&rsquo;m providing some good info you can actually use! Cheers!</p>

<time datetime="2014-02-18T18:48:18+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 18<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Workflows are like kickball games: everyone knows the general idea of what&rsquo;s
going on, there&rsquo;s an orderly progression towards an end-goal, nobody wants to
be excluded, and people lose their shit when they get hit in the face by a big
rubber ball.  Okay, so maybe it&rsquo;s not a perfect mapping but you get the idea.</p>

<p>The previous two posts (<a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/17/puppet-workflow-part-1/">one</a> and <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/17/puppet-workflow-part-2/">two</a>) focused on
writing modules, wrapping modules, and classification. While BOTH of these
things are very important in the grand scheme of things, one of the biggest
problems people get hung-up on is how do you iterate upon your modules, and,
more importantly, how do you eventually get these changes pushed into production
in a reasonably orderly fashion?</p>

<p>This post is going to be all over the place. We&rsquo;re gonna cover the idea of
separate environments in Puppet, touch on dynamic environments, and round it
out with that mother-of-a-shell-script-turned-personal-savior, R10k. Hold on
to your shit.</p>

<h2>Puppet Environments</h2>

<p><a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/environment.html">Puppet has the concept of &lsquo;environments&rsquo;</a> where you can logically
separate your modules and manifest (read: <code>site.pp</code>) into separate folders
to allow for nodes to get entirely separate bits of code based on which
&lsquo;environment&rsquo; the node belongs to.</p>

<p>Puppet environments are statically set in <code>puppet.conf</code>, but,
<a href="http://bit.ly/puppetgit">as other blog posts have noted</a>, you can do some crafty things in
<code>puppet.conf</code> to give you the solution of having &lsquo;dynamic environments&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The solutions in this post are going to rely on Puppet environments,
however environments aren&rsquo;t without their own shortcomings
<a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/12173">namely, this bug on Ruby plugins in Puppet</a>). For testing and
promoting Puppet classes written in the DSL, environments will help you out
greatly. For complete separation of Ruby instances and any plugins to Puppet
written in Ruby, however, you&rsquo;ll need separate masters (which is something that
I won&rsquo;t be covering in this article).</p>

<h2>One step further &ndash; &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; environments</h2>

<p>Adrien Thebo, hitherto known as &lsquo;Finch&rsquo;, &ndash; who is known for building awesome
things and talking like he&rsquo;s fresh from a Redbull binge &ndash; created the
<a href="http://bit.ly/puppetgit">now-famous blog post on creating dynamic environments in Puppet with git.</a>
That post relied upon a post-commit hook to do all the jiggery-pokery necessary
to checkout the correct branches in the correct places, and thus it had a heavy
reliance upon git.</p>

<p>Truly, the only magic in <code>puppet.conf</code> was the inclusion of &lsquo;$environment&rsquo; in
the <code>modulepath</code> configuration entry on the Puppet master (literally that
string and not the evaluated form of your environment). By doing that, the
Puppet master would replace the string &lsquo;$environment&rsquo; with the environment
of the node checking in and would look to that path for Puppet manifests
and modules. If you use something OTHER than git, it would be up to you to
create a post-receive hook that populated those paths, but you could still
replicate the results (albiet with a little work on your part).</p>

<p>People used this pattern and it worked fairly well. Hell, it STILL works
fairly well, nothing has changed to STOP you from using it. What changed,
however, was the ecosystem around modules, the need for individual module
testing, and the further need to automate this whole goddamn process.</p>

<p>Before we deliver the &lsquo;NEW SOLUTION&rsquo;, let&rsquo;s provide a bit of history and
context.</p>

<h2>Module repositories: the one-to-many problem</h2>

<p>I <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/17/puppet-workflow-part-1/">touched on this topic in the first post</a>, but one of the first
problems you encounter when putting your modules in version control is whether
or not to have ONE GIANT REPO with all of your modules, or a repository for
every module you create. In the past we recommended putting every module in
one repository (namely because it was easier, the module sharing landscape
was pretty barren, and teams were smaller). Now, we recommend the opposite
for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individual repos mean individual module development histories</li>
<li>Most VCS solutions don&rsquo;t have per-folder ACLs for a single repositories;
having multiple repos allows per-module security settings.</li>
<li>With the one-repository-per-module solution, modules you pull down from the
Forge (or Github) must be committed to your repo. Having multiple
repositories for each module allow you to keep everything separate</li>
<li>Publishing this module to the Forge (or Github/Stash/whatever) is easier
with separate repos (rather than having to split-out the module later).</li>
</ul>


<p>The problem with having a repository for every Puppet module you create is that
you need a way to map every module with every Puppet master (and, also which
version of every module should be installed in which Puppet environment).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet">A project called librarian-puppet</a> sprang up that created the
&lsquo;<code>Puppetfile</code>&rsquo;, a file that would map modules and their versions to a
specific directory. Librarian was awesome,
<a href="http://somethingsinistral.net/blog/scaling-puppet-environment-deployment/">but, as Finch noted in his post</a>, it had some shortcomings
when used in an environment with many and fast-changing modules.
<a href="http://somethingsinistral.net/blog/scaling-puppet-environment-deployment/">His solution, that he documented here,</a>, was the tool we now come
to know as R10k.</p>

<h2>Enter R10k</h2>

<p>R10k is essentially a Ruby project that wraps a bunch of shell commands you
would NORMALLY use to maintain an environment of ever-changing Puppet modules.
Its power is in its ability to use Git branches combined with a <code>Puppetfile</code>
to keep your Puppet environments in-sync. Because of this, R10k is CURRENTLY
restricted to git. There have been rumblings of porting it to Hg or svn, but
I know of no serious attempts at doing this (and if you ARE doing this, may
god have mercy on your soul). Great, so how does it work?</p>

<p>Well, you&rsquo;ll need one main repository SIMPLY for tracking the <code>Puppetfile</code>.
<a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">I&rsquo;ve got one right here,</a> and it only has my <code>Puppetfile</code> and a
<code>site.pp</code> file for classification (should you use it).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Puppetfile and librarian-puppet-like capabilities under the hood
are going to be doing most of the work here &ndash; this repository is solely so you
can create topic branches with changes to your <code>Puppetfile</code> that will
eventually become dynamically-created Puppet environments.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the <code>Puppetfile</code> and see what&rsquo;s going on:</p>

<p>This example lists the syntax for dealing with modules from both the
Forge and Github, as well as pulling specific versions of modules (whether
versions in the case of the Forge, or Github references as tags, branches,
or even specific commits). The syntax is not hard to follow &ndash; just remember
that we&rsquo;re mapping modules and their versions to a set/known environment.</p>

<p>For every topic branch on this repository (containing the <code>Puppetfile</code>), R10k
will in turn create a Puppet environment with the same name. For this reason,
it&rsquo;s convention to rename the &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch to &lsquo;production&rsquo; since that&rsquo;s the
default environment in Puppet (note that renaming branches locally is easy &ndash;
renaming the branch on Github can sometimes be a pain in the ass). You will
also note why it&rsquo;s going to be somewhat hard to map R10k to subversion, for
example, due to the lack of lightweight branching schemes.</p>

<p>To explain any more of R10k reads just as if I were describing its installation,
so let&rsquo;s quit screwing around and actually INSTALL/SETUP the damn thing.</p>

<h2>Setting up R10k</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, we <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">have the main repository</a> that will be
used to track the <code>Puppetfile</code>, which in turn will track the modules to
be installed (whether from The Forge, Github, or some internal git repo). Like
any good Puppet component, R10k itself can be setup with a Puppet module.
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/zack/r10k">The module I&rsquo;ll be using</a> was developed by <a href="https://github.com/acidprime">Zack Smith</a>,
and is pretty simple to get started. Let&rsquo;s download it from the forge first:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>The module will be installed into the first path in your modulepath, which in
the case above is <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules</code>. This modulepath will change
due to the way we&rsquo;re going to setup our dynamic Puppet environments. For this
example, I&rsquo;m going to have environments dynamically generated at
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments</code>, so let&rsquo;s create that directory first:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[root@master1 vagrant]# mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, we need to setup R10k on this machine. The module we downloaded will
allow us to do that, but we&rsquo;ll need to create a small Puppet manifest that
will allow us to setup R10k out-of-band from a regular Puppet run (you CAN
continuously-enforce R10k configuration in-band with your regular Puppet
run, but if we&rsquo;re setting up a Puppet master to use R10k to serve out dynamic
environments it&rsquo;s possible to create a chicken-and-egg situation.). Let&rsquo;s
generate a file called <code>r10k_installation.pp</code> in <code>/var/tmp</code> and have it look
like the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>/var/tmp/r10k_installation.pp </span></figcaption>

<p>So what is every section of that declaration doing?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>version =&gt; '1.1.3'</code></strong> sets the version of the R10k gem to install</li>
<li><strong><code>sources =&gt; {...}</code></strong> is a hash of sources that R10k is going to track. For
now it&rsquo;s only our <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a>, but you can also track a Hiera
installation too. This hash accepts key/value pairs for configuration settings
that are going to be written to <code>/etc/r10k.yaml</code>, which is R10k&rsquo;s main
configuration file. The keys in-use are <code>remote</code>, which is the path to the
repository to-be-checked-out by R10k, <code>basedir</code>, which is the path on-disk
to where dynamic environments are to be created (we&rsquo;re using the
<code>$::settings::confdir</code> variable which maps to the Puppet master&rsquo;s configuration
directory, or <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet</code>), and <code>prefix</code> which is a boolean
to determine whether to use R10k&rsquo;s source-prefixing feature. <strong>NOTE: the <code>false</code>
value is a BOOLEAN value, and thus SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED. Quoting it turns it
into a string, which matches as a boolean TRUE value. Don&rsquo;t quote <code>false</code> &ndash;
that&rsquo;s bad, mmkay.</strong></li>
<li><strong><code>purgedirs=&gt; ["${::settings::confdir}/environments"]</code></strong> is configuring R10k
to implement purging on the environments directory (so any folders that R10k
doesn&rsquo;t create it will delete). This configuration MAY be moot with newer
versions of R10k as I believe it implements this behavior by default.</li>
<li><strong><code>manage_modulepath =&gt; true</code></strong> will ensure that this module sets the <code>modulepath</code>
configuration item in <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf</code></li>
<li><strong><code>modulepath =&gt; ...</code></strong> sets the <code>modulepath</code> value to be dropped into
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf</code>. Note that we are interpolating variables
(<code>$::settings::confdir</code> again), AND inserting the LITERAL string of <code>$environment</code>
into the <code>modulepath</code> &ndash; this is because Puppet will replace <code>$environment</code> with
the value of the agent&rsquo;s environment at catalog compilation.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>JUST IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Don&rsquo;t quote the <code>false</code> value for the prefix setting
in the <code>sources</code> block. That is all.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, we have our one-time Puppet manifest, and now the only thing left to do
is to run it:</p>

<p>At this point, it goes without saying that <code>git</code> needs to be installed, but
if you&rsquo;re firing up a new VM that DOESN&rsquo;T have <code>git</code>, then R10k is going to
spit out an awesome error &ndash; so ensure that <code>git</code> is installed.  After that,
let&rsquo;s synchronize R10k with the <code>r10k deploy environment -pv</code> command (<code>-p</code>
for <code>Puppetfile</code> synchronization and <code>-v</code> for verbose mode):</p>

<p>I ran this first synchronization with verbose mode so you can see exactly what&rsquo;s
getting copied where. Futher synchronizations don&rsquo;t have to be in verbose mode,
but it&rsquo;s good for debugging. After all of that, we have an
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments</code> folder containing our dynamic Puppet
environments based off of the branches of the <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a>:</p>

<p>As you can see (at the time of this writing), my <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a>
has three main branches: <code>development</code>, <code>master</code>, and <code>production</code>, and so
R10k created three Puppet environments matching those names. It&rsquo;s somewhat
of a convention to rename the master branch to <code>production</code>, but in this
case I left it alone to demonstrate how this works.</p>

<p><strong>ONE OTHER BIG GOTCHA</strong>: R10k does NOT resolve dependencies, and
so it is UP TO YOU to track them in your Puppetfile.  Check this out:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve installed Puppet Enterprise 3.1.0, and so <code>/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules</code>
reflects the state of the Puppet Enterprise (also known as &lsquo;PE&rsquo;) modules at that
time. You can see that there are some conflicts because certain modules require
certain versions of other modules. This is currently the nature of the beast
with regard to Puppet modules. Some of these errors are loud and incidental
(i.e. someone set a dependency on a version and forgot to update it), some
are due to namespace changes (i.e. <code>cfprice-inifile</code> being ported over to
<code>puppetlabs-inifile</code>), and so on. Basically, ensure that you handle the
dependencies you care about inside the <code>Puppetfile</code> as R10k won&rsquo;t do it for you.</p>

<p>There &ndash; we&rsquo;ve done it!  We&rsquo;ve configured R10k!  Now how the hell do you use it?</p>

<h2>R10k demonstration &ndash; from module iteration to environment iteration</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the environment we&rsquo;ve setup in the previous steps and walk you
through adding a new module to your production environment, iterating upon
that module, pushing the changes to that module, pushing the changes to a
Puppet environment, and then promoting those changes to production.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES ON THE SETUP OF THIS DEMO:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In this demonstration, classification method is going to be left to the user
(i.e. it&rsquo;s not a part of the magic).  So, when I tell you to classify your
node with a specific class, I don&rsquo;t care if you use the Puppet Enterprise
Console, <code>site.pp</code>, or any other manner.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m using Github for my repositories so that you folk watching and playing
along at home can have something to follow. Feel free to substitute Github
for something like Atlassian Stash/Bitbucket, internal repos, or whatever.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Add the module to an environment</h3>

<p>The module we&rsquo;ll be working with, <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet-notifyme">a simple module called &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo;</a>,
will notify a message that will help us track the module&rsquo;s process through all
phases of iteration.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is to add the module to an environment, so let&rsquo;s
dynamically create a NEW environment by creating a new topic branch and pushing
it up to <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">the main puppet repo</a>. I will perform this step on my laptop
and outside of the VM I&rsquo;m using to test R10k:</p>

<p>I only included the relevant messages, but you can see that it pulled in a new
environment called &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; that ALSO pulled in a module called &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo;</p>

<h3>Rename the branch to avoid confusion</h3>

<p>Suddenly I realize that this may get confusing having both an environment called
&lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; with a module/class called &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo;. No worries, how about we rename
that branch?</p>

<p>That bit of <code>git</code> renamed the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; branch to &lsquo;garysawesomeenvironment&rsquo;.
The next git command is a bit tricky &ndash; when you <code>git push</code> to a remote, it&rsquo;s
supposed to be:</p>

<p><strong><code>git push name_of_origin local_branch_name:remote_branch_name</code></strong></p>

<p>In our case, the name of our origin is LITERALLY &lsquo;origin&rsquo;, but we actually want
to DELETE a remote branch. The way to delete a local branch is with
<code>git branch -d branch_name</code>, but the way to delete a REMOTE branch is to push
<strong>NOTHING</strong> to it.  So consider the following command:</p>

<p><strong><code>git push origin :notifyme</code></strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re pushing to the origin named &lsquo;origin&rsquo;, but providing NO local branch name
and pushing that bit of nothing to the remote branch of &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo;. This
kills (deletes) the remote branch.</p>

<p>Finally, we push to our origin named &lsquo;origin&rsquo; again and push the contents of
the local branch &lsquo;garysawesomeenvironment&rsquo; to the remote branch of
&lsquo;garysawesomeenvironment&rsquo; which in turn CREATES that branch if it doesn&rsquo;t exist.
Whew.  Let&rsquo;s run another damn synchronization:</p>

<h3>Run Puppet to test the new environment</h3>

<p>Perfect!  Now classify your node to include the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; class, and let&rsquo;s run
Puppet to see what we get when we try to join the environment called
&lsquo;garysawesomeenvronment&rsquo;:</p>

<p>We get an error because that module hasn&rsquo;t been loaded by R10k for that
environment.</p>

<h3>Tie a module version to an environment</h3>

<p>Okay, so we added a module to a new environment, but what if we want to test
out a specific commit, branch, or tag of a module and test it in this new
environment? This is frequently what you&rsquo;ll be doing &ndash; making a change to
an existing module, pushing your change to a topic branch of that module&rsquo;s
repository, tying it to an environment (or creating a new environment by
branching the main Puppet repository), and then testing the change.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to my &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; module that I&rsquo;ve cloned to my laptop and push
a change to a BRANCH of that module&rsquo;s Github repository:</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m showing you is the workflow that creates a new local branch called
&lsquo;change_the_message&rsquo; to the notifyme module, changes the message in my notify
resource, commits the change, and pushes the changes to a remote branch ALSO
called &lsquo;change_the_message&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Because I created a topic branch, I can provide that branch name in the
<code>Puppetfile</code> located in the &lsquo;garysawesomeenvironment&rsquo; branch of the
<a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a>. THAT is the piece that ties together the specific
version of the module with the Puppet environment we want on the Puppet master.
Here&rsquo;s that change:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Puppetfile </span></figcaption>

<p>Again, that change gets put into the &lsquo;garysawesomeenvironment&rsquo; branch of the
<a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a> and pushed up to the remote:</p>

<p>TADA! We&rsquo;ve successfully tied a specific version of a module to a specific
dynamic environment, deployed it to a master, and tested it out! Smell that?
That&rsquo;s the smell of awesome. Or Jeff in the next cubicle eating a burrito.
Either way, I like it.</p>

<h3>Merge your changes with master/production</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s green &ndash; fuck it; ship it! NOW you&rsquo;re speaking &lsquo;agile&rsquo;! Assuming everything
went according to plan, let&rsquo;s merge our changes in with the production
environment and synchronize.  This is up to your company&rsquo;s workflow docs
(whether you use pull requests, a merge master, or poke Patrick and tell
him to tell Andy to merge in your change). I&rsquo;m using git and Github, so
let&rsquo;s merge.</p>

<p>First, do the Module:</p>

<p>So now we have an issue, and that issue is that the production environment
has YET to have the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; module added to it.  If we merge the contents
of the &lsquo;garysawesomeenvironment&rsquo; branch with the &lsquo;production&rsquo; branch of the
<a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a>, then we&rsquo;re going to be pointing at the
&lsquo;change_the_message&rsquo; branch of the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; module (because that was our last
commit).</p>

<p>Because of this, I can&rsquo;t do a straight merge, can I? For posterity&rsquo;s sake (in
the event that someone in the future wants to look for that branch on my Github
repo), I&rsquo;m going to keep that branch alive. In a production environment, I
most likely would NOT have additional branches open for all my component modules
as that would get pretty annoying/confusing. Understand that this is a one-off
case because I&rsquo;m doing a demo. BECAUSE of this, I&rsquo;m going to modify the
<code>Puppetfile</code> in the &lsquo;production&rsquo; branch of the <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a>:</p>

<p>Alright, we&rsquo;ve updated the production environment, now synchronize again

<p>Beautiful, we&rsquo;re synchronized!!!</p>

<h3>Making a change to an EXISTING module in an environment</h3>

<p>Okay, so we saw previously how to add a NEW module to an environment, but what
if we already HAVE a module in an environment and we want to make an update/change
to it?  Well, it&rsquo;s largely the same process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cut a branch to the module</li>
<li>Commit your code and push it up to the module&rsquo;s repo</li>
<li>Cut a branch to the <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a></li>
<li>Push that branch up to the <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a></li>
<li>Perform an R10k synchronization to sync the environments</li>
<li>Test your changes</li>
<li>Merge the changes with the master branch of the module</li>
<li>DONE!</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s go back and change that notify message again, shall we?</p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s re-use &lsquo;garysawesomeenvironment&rsquo; because I like the name, but
tie it to the new &lsquo;another_change&rsquo; branch of the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; module:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the message that I changed in the &lsquo;another_change&rsquo; branch of my &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo;

<p>There&rsquo;s the old message that&rsquo;s in the &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch of the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo;
module (which is where the &lsquo;production&rsquo; branch <code>Puppetfile</code> is pointing).
To merge the changes into the production environment, we now only have to
do one thing: that&rsquo;s merge the changes in the &lsquo;another_change&rsquo; branch of
the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; module to the &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch &ndash; that&rsquo;s it!  Why? Because
the <code>Puppetfile</code> in the <code>production</code> branch of the <a href="https://github.com/glarizza/puppet_repository">main Puppet repo</a>
(and thus the production Puppet ENVIRONMENT) is already POINTING at the
master branch of the &lsquo;notifyme&rsquo; module.  Let&rsquo;s do the merge:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the message that was previously in the &lsquo;another_change&rsquo; branch that&rsquo;s
been merged to the &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch (and thus is entered into the production
Puppet environment).</p>

<h3>OR, use tags</h3>

<p>One more note &ndash; for production environments that want a BIT more stability
(rather than hoping that someone follows the policy of pushing commits to
a BRANCH of a module rather than pushing directly to master &ndash; by accident or
otherwise &ndash; and allowing that commit to make DIRECTLY it into production), the
better way is to tie all modules to some sort of release version. For modules
released to the Puppet Forge, that&rsquo;s a version, for modules stored in git
repositories, that would be a tag. Tying all modules in your production
environment (and thus production <code>Puppetfile</code>) to specific tags in git
repositories IS a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; to ensure that the code that&rsquo;s executed in
production has some sort of &lsquo;safe guard&rsquo;.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Example tied to &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch above was demo, and not necessarily
recommended for your production needs.</p>

<h2>Holy crap, that&rsquo;s a lot to take in&hellip;</h2>

<p>Yeah, tell me about it. And, believe it or not, I&rsquo;m STILL not done with
everything that I want to talk about regarding R10k &ndash; there&rsquo;s still more
info on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using R10k with a monolithic modules repo</li>
<li>Incorporating Hiera data</li>
<li>Triggering R10k with MCollective</li>
<li>Tying R10k to CI workflow</li>
</ul>


<p>Those will come in a later post once I have time to decide how to tackle them.
Until then, this should give you more than enough information to get started
with R10k in your own environment.</p>

<p>If you have any questions/comments/corrections, PLEASE enter them in the
comments below and I&rsquo;ll be happy to respond when I&rsquo;m not flying from gig to
gig! :)  Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://www.garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/17/puppet-workflow-part-1/">first post</a>, I talked about writing functional component
modules. Well, I didn&rsquo;t really do much detailing other than pointing out
key bits of information that tend to cause problems. In this post, I&rsquo;ll
describe the next layer to the functional Puppet module workflow.</p>

<p>People usually stop once they have a library of component modules (whether
hand-written, taken from Github, or pulled from <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com">The Forge</a>). The idea
is that you can classify all of your nodes in <code>site.pp</code>, the Puppet
Enterprise Console, The Foreman, or with some other ENC, so why not just
declare all your classes for every node when you need them?</p>

<p>Because that&rsquo;s a lot of extra work and opportunities for fuckups.</p>

<p>People recognized this, so in the EARLY days of Puppet they would create node
blocks in <code>site.pp</code> and use inheritance to inherit from those blocks. This was
the right IDEA, but probably not the best PLACE for it. Eventually, &lsquo;Profiles&rsquo;
were born.</p>

<p>The idea of &lsquo;Roles and Profiles&rsquo; originally came from a piece that
<a href="http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/">Craig Dunn wrote</a> while he worked for the BBC, and then
<a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2012/12/day-13-configuration-management-as-legos.html">Adrien Thebo also wrote a piece</a> that documents the same sort of pattern.
So why am I writing about it a THIRD time? Well, because I feel it&rsquo;s only a PIECE
of an overall puzzle. The introduction of Hiera and other awesome tools (like R10k,
which we will get to on the next post) still make Roles and Profiles VIABLE, but
they also extend upon them.</p>

<p>One final note before we move on &ndash; the terms &lsquo;Roles&rsquo; and &lsquo;Profiles&rsquo; are ENTIRELY
ARBITRARY. They&rsquo;re not magic reserve words in Puppet, and you can call them
whatever the hell you want. It&rsquo;s also been pointed out that Craig MIGHT have
misnamed them (a ROLE should be a model for an individual piece of tech, and a
PROFILE should probably be a group of roles), but, like all good Puppet Labs
employees &ndash; we suck at naming things.</p>

<h2>Profiles: technology-specific wrapper classes</h2>

<p>A profile is simply a wrapper class that groups Hiera lookups and class
declarations into one functional unit. For example, if you wanted Wordpress
installed on a machine, you&rsquo;d probably need to declare the apache class to
get Apache setup, declare an <code>apache::vhost</code> for the Wordpress directory,
setup a MySQL database with the appropriate classes, and so on. There are
a lot of components that go together when you setup a piece of technology,
it&rsquo;s not just a single class.</p>

<p>Because of this, a profile exists to give you a single class you can include
that will setup all the necessary bits for that piece of technology (be it
Wordpress, or Tomcat, or whatever).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a simple profile for Wordpress:</p>

<h3>Name your profiles according to the technology they setup</h3>

<p>Profiles are technology-specific, so you&rsquo;ll have one to setup wordpress, and
tomcat, and jenkins, and&hellip;well, you get the picture. You can also namespace
your profiles so that you have <code>profiles::ssh::server</code> and
<code>profiles::ssh::client</code> if you want. You can even have
<code>profiles::jenkins::tomcat</code> and <code>profiles::jenkins::jboss</code> or however you need
to namespace according to the TECHNOLOGIES you use. You don&rsquo;t need to include
your environment in the profile name (a la <code>profiles::dev::tomcat</code>) as the bits
of data that make the dev environment different from production should come
from <strong>HIERA</strong>, and thus aren&rsquo;t going to be different on a per-profile basis.
You CAN setup profiles according to your business unit if multiple units use
Puppet and have different setups (a la <code>security::profiles::tomcat</code> versus
<code>ops::profiles::tomcat</code>), but the GOAL of Puppet is to have one main set of
modules that every group uses (and the Hiera data being different for every
group). That&rsquo;s the GOAL, but I&rsquo;m pragmatic enough to understand that not
everywhere is a shiny, happy &lsquo;DevOps Garden.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>Do all Hiera lookups in the profile</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see that I declared variables and set their values with Hiera lookups.
The profile is the place for these lookups because the profile collects all
external data and declares all the classes you&rsquo;ll need. In reality, you&rsquo;ll
<strong>USUALLY</strong> only see profiles looking up parameters and declaring classes
(i.e. declaring users and groups like I did above will USUALLY be left to
component classes).</p>

<p>I do the Hiera lookups first to make it easy to debug from where those values
came. I don&rsquo;t rely on <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/puppet.html#automatic-parameter-lookup">&lsquo;Automatic Parameter Lookup&rsquo;</a> in Puppet
3.x.x because it can be &lsquo;magic&rsquo; for people who aren&rsquo;t aware of it (for people
new to Puppet, it&rsquo;s much easier to see a function call and trace back what it
does rather than experience Puppet doing something unseen and wondering what
the hell happened).</p>

<p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll notice that my Hiera lookups have <strong>NO DEFAULT VALUES</strong> &ndash; this
is <strong>BY DESIGN!</strong>  For most people, their Hiera data is <strong>PROBABLY</strong> located in
a separate repository as their Puppet module data. Imagine making a change to
your profile to have it lookup a bit of data from Hiera, and then imagine you
FORGOT to put that data into Hiera. What happens if you provide a default value
to Hiera? The catalog compiles, that default value gets passed down to the
component module, and gets enforced on disk. If you have good tests, you MIGHT
see that the component you configured has a bit of data that&rsquo;s not correct, but
what if you don&rsquo;t have a great post-Puppet testing workflow? Puppet will
correctly set this default value, according to Puppet everything is green and
worked just fine, but now your component is setup incorrectly. That&rsquo;s one of
the WORST failures &ndash; the ones that you don&rsquo;t catch.  Now, imagine you DON&rsquo;T
provide a default value. In THIS case, Puppet will raise a compilation error
because a Hiera lookup didn&rsquo;t return a value. You&rsquo;ll catch your error before
anything gets pushed to Production and you can catch the screwup. This is
a MUCH better solution.</p>

<h3>Use parameterized class declarations and explicitly pass values you care about</h3>

<p>The parameterized class declaration syntax can be dangerous. The difference
between the <code>include</code> function and the parameterized class syntax is that
the <code>include</code> function is idempotent. You can do the following in a Puppet
manifest, and Puppet doesn&rsquo;t raise an error:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>include apache
</span><span class='line'>include apache
</span><span class='line'>include apache</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is because the <code>include</code> function checks to see if the class is in the
catalog. If it ISN&rsquo;T, then it adds it. If it IS, then it exits cleanly. The
<code>include</code> function is your pal.</p>

<p>Consider THIS manifest:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class { 'apache': }
</span><span class='line'>include apache
</span><span class='line'>include apache</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Does this work?  Yep.  The parameterized class syntax adds the class to the
catalog, the include function detects this and exits cleanly twice.  What
about THIS manifest:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>include apache
</span><span class='line'>class { 'apache': }
</span><span class='line'>include apache</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Does THIS work?  Nope!  Puppet raises a compilation error because a class was
declared more than once in a catalog.  Why?  Well, consider that Puppet is
&lsquo;declarative&rsquo;&hellip;all the way up until it isn&rsquo;t.  Puppet&rsquo;s PARSER reads from the
top of the file to the bottom of the file, and we have a single-pass parser
when it comes to things like setting variables and declaring classes. When
the parser hits the first include function, it adds the class to the catalog.
The parameterized class syntax, however, is a honey badger: it doesn&rsquo;t give
a shit. It adds a class to the catalog regardless of whether it already exists
or not. So why would we EVER use the parameterized class declaration syntax?
We need to use it because the include function doesn&rsquo;t allow you to pass
parameters when you declare a class.</p>

<p>So wait &ndash; why did I spend all this time explaining why the parameterized class
syntax is more dangerous than the include function <strong>ONLY</strong> to recommend its
use in profiles?  For two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to use it to pass parameters to classes</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re wrapping its use in a class that we can <strong>IN TURN</strong> declare with the <code>include</code> function</li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, we can get the best of BOTH worlds, the ability to pass parameters and
the use of our pal the <code>include</code> function, with this wrapper class. We&rsquo;ll see
the latter usage when we come to roles, but for now let&rsquo;s focus on passing
parameter values.</p>

<p>In the first section, we set variables with Hiera lookups, now we can pass
those variables to classes we&rsquo;re declaring with the parameterized class syntax.
This allows the declaration of the class to be static, but the parameters we
pass to that class to change according to the Hiera hierarchy. We&rsquo;ve explicitly
called the <code>hiera</code> function, so it makes it easier to debug, and we&rsquo;re explicitly
passing parameter values so we know definitively which parameters are being
passed (and thus are overriding default values) to the component module. Finally,
since our component modules do NOT use Hiera at all, we can be sure that if we&rsquo;re
not passing a parameter that it&rsquo;s getting its value from the default set in the
module&rsquo;s <code>::params</code> class.</p>

<p>Everything we do here is meant to make things easier to debug when it&rsquo;s 3am and
things aren&rsquo;t working. Any asshole can do crazy shit in Puppet, but a seasoned
sysadmin writes their code for ease of debugging during 3am pages.</p>

<h3>An annoying Puppet bug &ndash; top-level class declarations and profiles</h3>

<p><a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/2053">Oh, ticket 2053</a>, how terrible are you? This is one of those bug numbers
that I can remember by heart (like <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/8040">8040</a> and <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/86">86</a>). Puppet has
the ability to do &lsquo;relative namespacing&rsquo;, which allows you to declare a variable
called <code>$port</code> in a class called <code>$apache</code> and refer to it as <code>$port</code> instead
of fully-namespacing the variable, and thus having to call it <code>$apache::port</code>
inside the <code>apache</code> class. It&rsquo;s a shortcut &ndash; you can STILL refer to the variable
as <code>$apache::port</code> in the class &ndash; but it comes in handy. The PROBLEM occurs when
you create a profile, as we did above, called <code>profiles::wordpress</code> and you try
to declare a class called <code>wordpress</code>.  If you do the following inside the
<code>profiles::wordpress</code> class, what class is being declared:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>include wordpress</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you think you&rsquo;re declaring a wordpress class from within a wordpress module
in your Puppet modulepath, you would be wrong.  Puppet ACTUALLY thinks you&rsquo;re
trying to declare <code>profiles::wordpress</code> because you&rsquo;re INSIDE the <code>profiles::wordpress</code>
class and it&rsquo;s doing relative namespacing (i.e. in the same way you refer to <code>$port</code>
and ACTUALLY mean <code>$apache::port</code> it thinks you&rsquo;re referring to <code>wordpress</code> and
ACTUALLY mean <code>profiles::wordpress</code>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this causes LOTS of confusion.</p>

<p>The solution here is to declare a class called <code>::wordpress</code> which tells Puppet
to go to the top-level namespace and look for a module called <code>wordpress</code> which
has a top-level class called <code>wordpress</code>. It&rsquo;s the same reason that we refer to
Facter Fact values as <code>$::osfamily</code> instead of <code>$osfamily</code> in class definitions
(because you can declare a local variable called <code>$osfamily</code> in your class).
This is why in the profile above you see this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class { '::wordpress':
</span><span class='line'>  install_dir =&gt; $wordpress_docroot,
</span><span class='line'>  db_name     =&gt; $wordpress_db_name,
</span><span class='line'>  db_host     =&gt; $wordpress_db_host,
</span><span class='line'>  db_password =&gt; $wordpress_db_password,
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you use profiles and roles, you&rsquo;ll need to do this namespacing trick when
declaring classes because you&rsquo;re frequently going to have a <code>profile::&lt;sometech&gt;</code>
that will declare the <code>&lt;sometech&gt;</code> top-level class.</p>

<h2>Roles: business-specific wrapper classes</h2>

<p>How do you refer to your machines? When I ask you about that cluster over
there, do you say &ldquo;Oh, you mean the machines with java 1.6, apache, mysql,
etc&hellip;&rdquo;?  I didn&rsquo;t think so. You usually have names for them, like the
&ldquo;internal compute cluster&rdquo; or &ldquo;app builder nodes&rdquo; or &ldquo;DMZ repo machines&rdquo; or
whatever. These names are your Roles. Roles are just the mapping of your
machine&rsquo;s names to the technology that should be ON them. In the past we had
descriptive hostnames that afforded us a code for what the machine &lsquo;did&rsquo; &ndash;
roles are just that mapping for Puppet.</p>

<p>Roles are namespaced just like profiles, but now it&rsquo;s up to your organization
to fill in the blanks. Some people immediately want to put environments into
the roles (a la <code>roles::uat::compute_cluster</code>), but that&rsquo;s usually not necessary
(as MOST LIKELY the compute cluster nodes have the SAME technology on them
when they&rsquo;re in dev versus when they&rsquo;re in prod, it&rsquo;s just the DATA &ndash; like
database names, VIP locations, usernames/passwords, etc &ndash; that&rsquo;s different.
Again, these data differences will come from Hiera, so there should be no reason
to put the environment name in your role). You still CAN put the environment
name in the role if it makes you feel better, but it&rsquo;ll probably be useless.</p>

<h3>Roles ONLY include profiles</h3>

<p>So what exactly is in the role wrapper class? That depends on what technology
is on the node that defines that role. What I can tell you for CERTAIN is that
roles should ONLY use the <code>include</code> function and should ONLY include profiles.
What does this give us? This gives us our pal the <code>include</code> function back! You
can include the same profile 100 times if you want, and Puppet only puts it in
the catalog once.</p>

<h3>Every node is classified with one role. Period.</h3>

<p>The beautiful thing about roles and profiles is that the GOAL is that you
should be able to classify a node with a SINGLE role and THAT&rsquo;S IT. This makes
classification simple and static &ndash; the node gets its role, the role includes
profiles, profiles call out to Hiera for data, that data is passed to component
modules, and away we go. Also, since classification is static, you can use
version control to see what changes were introduced to the role (i.e. what
profiles were added or removed).  In my opinion, if you need to apply more
than one role to a node, you&rsquo;ve introduced a new role (see below).</p>

<h3>Roles CAN use inheritance&hellip;if you like</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people implement roles a couple of different ways, and one of them
is to use inheritance to build a catalog.  For example, you can define a base
<code>roles</code> class that includes something like a base security profile (i.e.
something that EVERY node in your infrastructure should have). Moving down the
line, you COULD namespace according to function like <code>roles::app</code> for your
application server machines. The <code>roles::app</code> class could inherit from the <code>roles</code>
class (which gets the base security profile), and could then include the profiles
necessary to setup an application server. Next, you could subclass down to
<code>roles::app::site_foo</code> for an application server that supports some site in
your organization.  That class inherits from the <code>roles::app</code> class, and then
adds profiles that are specific to that site (maybe they use Jboss instead of
Tomcat, and thus that&rsquo;s where the differentiation occurs). This is great
because you don&rsquo;t have a lot of repeated use of the <code>include</code> function, but
it also makes it hard to definitively look at a specific role to see exactly
what&rsquo;s being declared (i.e. all the profiles). You have to weigh what you
value more: less typing or greater visibility. I will err on the side of
greater visibility (just due to that whole 3am outage thing), but it&rsquo;s up
to you to decide what to optimize for.</p>

<h3>A role similar, yet different, from another role is: a new role</h3>

<p>EVERYBODY says to me &ldquo;Gary, I have this machine that&rsquo;s an AWFUL LOT like
this role over here, but&hellip;it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; My answer to them is: &ldquo;Great,
that&rsquo;s another role.&rdquo;  If the thing that&rsquo;s different is data (i.e. which
database to connect to, or what IP address to route traffic through),
then that difference should be put in HIERA and the classification should
remain the same. If that difference is technology-specific (i.e. this server
uses JBoss instead of Tomcat) then first look and see if you can isolate
how you know this machine is different (maybe it&rsquo;s on a different subnet,
maybe it&rsquo;s at a different location, something like that). If you can figure
that out and write a Fact for it (or use similar conditional logic to determine
this logically), then you can just drop that conditional logic in your role
and let it do the heavy lifting. If, in the end, this bit of data is totally
arbitrary, then you&rsquo;ll need to create another role (perhaps a subclass using
the above namespacing) and assign it to your node.</p>

<p>The hardest thing about this setup is naming your roles. Why? Every site is
different.  It&rsquo;s hard for me to account for differences in your setup because
your workplace is dysfunctional (seriously).</p>

<h2>Review: what does this get you?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through every level of this setup from the top to the bottom and see
what it gets you. Every node is classified to a single role, and, for the most
part, that classification isn&rsquo;t going to change. Now you can take all the extra
work off your classifier tool and put it back into the manifests (that are
subject to version control, so you can <code>git blame</code> to your heart&rsquo;s content and
see who last changed the role/profile). Each role is going to include one or
more profile, which gives us the added idempotent protection of the include
function (of course, if profiles have collisions with classes you&rsquo;ll have to
resolve those. Say one or more profiles tries to include an apache class &ndash;
simply break that component out into a separate profile, extract the parameters
from Hiera, and include that profile at a higher level). Each profile is going
to do Hiera lookups which should give you the ability to provide different data
for different host types (i.e. different data on a per-environment level, or
however you lay out your Hiera hierarchy), and that data will be passed
directly to class that is declared. Finally, each component module will
accept parameters as variables internal to that module, default
parameters/variables to sane values in the <code>::params</code> class, and use those
variables when declaring each resource throughtout its classes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Roles abstract profiles</li>
<li>Profiles abstract component modules</li>
<li>Hiera abstracts configuration data</li>
<li>Component modules abstract resources</li>
<li>Resources abstract the underlying OS implementation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Choose your level of comfortability</h2>

<p>The roles and profiles pattern also buys you something else &ndash; the ability for
less-skilled and more-skilled Puppet users to work with the same codebase.
Let&rsquo;s say you use some GUI classifier (like the Puppet Enterprise Console),
someone who&rsquo;s less skilled at Puppet looks and sees that a node is classified
with a certain role, so they open the role file and see something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>include profiles::wordpress
</span><span class='line'>include profiles::tomcat
</span><span class='line'>include profiles::git::repo_server</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s pretty legible, right? Someone who doesn&rsquo;t regularly use Puppet can
probably make a good guess as to what&rsquo;s on the machine. Need more information?
Open one of the profiles and look specifically at the classes that are being
declared. Need to know the data being passed? Jump into Hiera. Need to know
more information? Dig into each component module and see what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>

<p>When you have everything abstracted correctly, you can have developers
providing data (like build versions) to Hiera, junior admins grouping nodes for
classification, more senior folk updating profiles, and your best Puppet people
creating/updating component modules and building plugins like custom
facts/functions/whatever.</p>

<h2>Great! Now go and refactor&hellip;</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used Puppet for more than a month, you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the
&ldquo;Oh shit, I should have done it THAT way&hellip;let me refactor this&rdquo; game. I know,
it sucks, and we at Puppet Labs haven&rsquo;t been shy of incorporating something that
we feel will help people out (but will also require some refactoring). This
pattern, though, has been in use by the Professional Services team at Puppet Labs
for over a year without modification. I&rsquo;ve used this on sites GREAT and small,
and every site with which I&rsquo;ve consulted and implemented this pattern has been
able to both understand its power and derive real value within a week. If you&rsquo;re
contemplating a refactor, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with Roles and Profiles (or
whatever names you decide to use).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Working as a professional services engineer for <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com">Puppet Labs</a>,
my life consists almost entirely of either correcting some of the worst code
atrocities you&rsquo;ve seen in your life, or helping people get started with Puppet
so that they don&rsquo;t need to call us again due to: A.) Said code atrocities or
B.) Refactor the work we JUST helped them start.  It wasn&rsquo;t ALWAYS like this &ndash;
I can remember some of my earliest gigs, and I almost feel like I should go
revisit them if only to correct some of the previous &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; that
didn&rsquo;t quite pan out.</p>

<p>This would be exactly why I&rsquo;m wary of &lsquo;Best Practices&rsquo; &ndash; because one person&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Best Practice&rsquo; is another person&rsquo;s &lsquo;What the fuck did you just do?!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Having said that, I&rsquo;m finding myself repeating a story over and over again when
I train/consult, and that&rsquo;s the story of &lsquo;The Usable Puppet Workflow.&rsquo;  Everybody
wants to know &lsquo;The Right Way™&rsquo;, and I feel like we finally have a way that survives
a reasonable test of time. I&rsquo;ve been promoting this workflow for over a year (which
is a HELL of a long time in Startup time), and I&rsquo;ve yet to really see an edge case
it couldn&rsquo;t handle.</p>

<p>(If you&rsquo;re already savvy: yes, this is the Roles and Profiles talk)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be breaking this workflow down into separate blog posts for every component,
and, as always, your comments are welcome&hellip;</p>

<h2>It all starts with the component module</h2>

<p>The first piece of a functional Puppet deployment starts with what we call
&lsquo;component modules&rsquo;.  Component modules are the lowest level in your
deployment, and are modules that configure specific pieces of technology (like
apache, ntp, mysql, and etc&hellip;).  Component modules are well-encapsulated, have
a reasonable API, and focus on doing small, specific things really well (i.e.
the *nix way).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to write thousands of words on building component modules because
I feel like others have done this better than I. As examples, check out
<a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2012/12/13/simple-puppet-module-structure-redux.php">RI&rsquo;s Post on a simple module structure</a>,
<a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/module_guides/bgtm.html">Puppet Labs&#8217; very own docs on the subject</a>,
<a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1651-puppetconf2012-puppet-modules-for-fun-and-profit">and even Alessandro&rsquo;s Puppetconf 2012 session.</a> Instead, I&rsquo;d like to
provide some pointers on what I feel makes a good component module, and some
&lsquo;gotchas&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>

<h3>Parameters are your API</h3>

<p>In the current world of Puppet, you MUST define the parameters your module will
accept in the Puppet DSL. Also, every parameter MUST ultimately have a value
when Puppet compiles the catalog (whether by explicitly passing this parameter
value when declaring the class, or by assuming a default value). Yes, it&rsquo;s
funny that, when writing a Puppet class, if you typo a VARIABLE Puppet will
not alert you to this (in a NON <code>use strict</code>-ian sort of approach) and will
happily accept a variable in an undefined state, but the second you don&rsquo;t pass
a value to your class parameter you&rsquo;re in for a rude compilation error.
This is the way of Puppet classes at the time of this writing, so you&rsquo;re going
to see Puppet classes with LINES of defined parameters. I expect this to change
in the future (please let this change in the near future), but for now, it&rsquo;s
a necessary evil.</p>

<p>The parameters you expose to your top-level class (i.e. given class names like
<code>apache</code> and <code>apache::install</code>, I&rsquo;m talking specifically about <code>apache</code>) should
be treated as an API to your module. IDEALLY, they&rsquo;re the ONLY THING that
a user needs to modify when using your module. Also, whenever possible, it
should be the case that a user need ONLY interact with the top-level class when
using your module (of course, defined resource types like <code>apache::vhost</code> are
used on an ad-hoc basis, and thus are the exception here).</p>

<h3>Inherit the <code>::params</code> class</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re starting to make enemies at this point. It&rsquo;s been a convention for modules
to use a <code>::params</code> class to assign values to all variables that are going to
be used for all classes inside the module. The idea is that the <code>::params</code> class
is the one-stop-shop to see where a variable is set. Also, to get access to a
variable that&rsquo;s set in a Puppet class, you have to declare the class (i.e. use
the <code>include()</code> function or inherit from that class). When you declare a class
that has both variables AND resources, those resources get put into the catalog,
which means that Puppet ENFORCES THE STATE of those resources. What if you only
needed a variable&rsquo;s value and didn&rsquo;t want to enforce the rest of the resources
in that class? There&rsquo;s no good way in Puppet to do that. Finally, when you inherit
from a class in Puppet that has assigned variable values, you ALSO get access
to those variables in the parameter definition section of your class (i.e. the
following section of the class:</p>

<pre><code>class apache (
  $port = $apache::params::port,
  $user = $apache::params::user,
) inherits apache::params {
</code></pre>

<p>See how I set the default value of <code>$apache::port</code> to <code>$apache::params::port</code>?
I could only access the value of the variable <code>$apache::params::port</code> in that
section by inheriting from the <code>apache::params</code> class.  I couldn&rsquo;t insert
<code>include apache::params</code> below that section and be allowed access to the variable
up in the parameter defaults section (due to the way that Puppet parses classes).</p>

<p><strong>FOR THIS REASON, THIS IS THE </strong><em>ONLY</em><strong> RECOMMENDED USAGE OF INHERITANCE IN
PUPPET!</strong></p>

<p>We do NOT recommend using inheritance anywhere else in Puppet and for any other
reason because there are better ways to achieve what you want to do INSTEAD of
using inheritance.  Inheritance is a holdover from a scarier, more lawless time.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Data in Modules</strong> &ndash; There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Data in Modules&rsquo; pattern out there that
attempts to eliminate the <code>::params</code> class.  <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/12/08/when-to-hiera/">I wrote about it in a previous post</a>,
and I recommend you read that post for more info (it&rsquo;s near the bottom).</p>

<h3>Do <strong>NOT</strong> do Hiera lookups in your component modules!</h3>

<p>This is something that&rsquo;s really only RECENTLY been pushed. When Hiera was
released, we quickly recognized that it would be the answer to quite a few
problems in Puppet. In the rush to adopt Hiera, many people started adding
Hiera calls to their modules, and suddenly you had &lsquo;Hiera-compatible&rsquo; modules
out there. This caused all kinds of compatibility problems, and it was largely
because there wasn&rsquo;t a better module structure and workflow by which to integrate
Hiera. The pattern that I&rsquo;ll be pushing DOES INDEED use Hiera, <strong>BUT</strong> it
confines all Hiera calls to a higher-level wrapper class we call a &lsquo;profile&rsquo;.
The reasons for NOT using Hiera in your module are:</p>

<ul>
<li>By doing Hiera calls at a higher level, you have a greater visibility on
exactly what parameters were set by Hiera and which were set explicitly or by
default values.</li>
<li>By doing Hiera calls elsewhere, your module is backwards-compatible for
those folks who are NOT using Hiera</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember &ndash; your module should just accept a value and use it somewhere. Don&rsquo;t
get <strong>TOO</strong> smart with your component module &ndash; leave the logic for other
places.</p>

<h3>Keep your component modules generic</h3>

<p>We always get asked &ldquo;How do I know if I&rsquo;m writing a good module?&rdquo; We USED to
say &ldquo;Well, does it work?&rdquo; (and trust me, that was a BIG hurdle). Now, with
data separation models out there like Hiera, I have a couple of other questions
that I ask (you know, BEYOND asking if it compiles and actually installs the
thing it&rsquo;s supposed to install). The best way I&rsquo;ve found to determine if your
module is &lsquo;generic enough&rsquo; is if I asked you TODAY to give me your module,
would you give it to me, or would you be worried that there was some
company-specific data locked in there? If you have company-specific data in
your module, then you need to refactor the module, store the data in Hiera, and
make your module more generic/reusable. Also, does your module focus on installing
one piece of technology, or are you declaring packages for shared libraries
or other components (like gcc, apache, or other common components)? You&rsquo;re
not going to win any prizes for having the biggest, most monolithic module
out there. Rather, if your module is that large and that complex, you&rsquo;re
going to have a hell of a time debugging it. Err on the side of making your
modules smaller and more task-specific. So what if you end up needing to
declare 4 classes where you previously declared 1? In the roles and profiles
pattern we will show you in the next blog post, you can abstract that away
ANYHOW.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t play the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; game</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had more than a couple of gigs where the customer says something along the
lines of &ldquo;What if we need to introduce FreeBSD/Solaris/etc&hellip; nodes into our
organization, shouldn&rsquo;t I account for them now?&rdquo; This leads more than a few
people down a path of entirely too-complex modules that become bulky and
unwieldy. Yes, your modules should be formatted so that you can simply add
another case in your <code>::params</code> class for another OS&rsquo;s parameters, and yes,
your module should be formatted so that your <code>::install</code> or <code>::config</code>
class can handle another OS, but if you currently only manage Redhat, and
you&rsquo;ve only EVER managed Redhat, then don&rsquo;t start adding Debian parameters
RIGHT NOW just because you&rsquo;re afraid you might inherit Ubuntu machines. The
goal of Puppet is to automate the tasks that eat up the MAJORITY of your time
so you can focus on the edge cases that really demand your time. If you can
eventually automate those edge cases, then AWESOME! Until then, don&rsquo;t spend
the majority of your time trying to automate the edge cases only to drown
under the weight of deadlines from simple work that you COULD have already
automated (but didn&rsquo;t, because you were so worried about the exceptions)!</p>

<h3>Store your modules in version control</h3>

<p>This should go without saying, but your modules should be stored in version
control (a la git, svn, hg, whatever). We tend to prefer git due to its lightweight
branching and merging (most of our tooling and solutions will use git because
we&rsquo;re big git users), but you&rsquo;re free to use whatever you want. The bigger
question is HOW to store your modules in version control. There are usually
two schools of thought:</p>

<ul>
<li>One repository per module</li>
<li>All modules in a single repository</li>
</ul>


<p>Each model has its pros and cons, but we tend to recommend one module per
repository for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individual repos mean individual module development histories</li>
<li>Most VCS solutions don&rsquo;t have per-folder ACLs for a single repositories;
having multiple repos allows per-module security settings.</li>
<li>With the one-repository-per-module solution, modules you pull down from the
Forge (or Github) must be committed to your repo. Having multiple
repositories for each module allow you to keep everything separate</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This becomes important in the third blog post in the series when we
talk about moving changes to each Puppet Environment, but it&rsquo;s important to
introduce it NOW as a &lsquo;best practice&rsquo;. If you use our recommended module/environment
solution, then one-module-per-repo is the best practice. If you DON&rsquo;T use our
solution, then the single repository per for all modules will STILL work,
but you&rsquo;ll have to manage the above issues. Also note that even if you currently
have every module in a single repository, you can STILL use our solution in
part 3 of the series (you&rsquo;ll just need to perform a couple of steps to conform).</p>

<h2>Best practices are shit</h2>

<p>In general, &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; are only recommended if they fit into your organizational
workflow. The best and worst part of Puppet is that it&rsquo;s infinitely customizable,
so &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; will invariably be left wanting for a certain subset of the
community. As always, take what I say under consideration; it&rsquo;s quite possible
that I could be entirely full of shit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Clarke&rsquo;s third law states: &ldquo;Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic.&rdquo; In the case of Ruby and Puppet provider
interaction, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe it. If you want proof, take a look at some
of the native Puppet types &ndash; no amount of &lsquo;Expecto Patronum&rsquo; will free you from
the Ruby metaprogramming dementors that hover around
<code>lib/puppet/provider/exec</code>-land.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/11/25/fun-with-providers/">first post tackling Puppet types and providers</a>, I introduced
the concept of Puppet types and the utility they provide. <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/11/26/fun-with-providers-part-2/">In the second post,</a>
I brought you to the great plain of Puppet providers and introduced the core
methods necessary for creating a very basic Puppet provider with a single property
(HINT: if you&rsquo;ve not read either of those posts, or you&rsquo;ve never dealt with basic
types and providers, you might want to stop here and read up a bit on the topics).
The problems with a provider like the one created in that post were:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>puppet resource</code> support wasn&rsquo;t implemented, so you couldn&rsquo;t query for existing instances of the type on the system (and their corresponding values)</li>
<li>The getter method would be called for EVERY instance of the type on the system, which would mean shelling-out multiple times during a run</li>
<li>Ditto for the setter method (if changes to multiple instances of the type were necessary)</li>
<li>That type was VERY basic (i.e. ensurable with a single property)</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately, when most of us have the need of a Puppet type and provider, we
usually require multiple properties and reasonably complex system interaction. When
it comes to creating both a getter and a setter method for every property (including
the potential performance hit that could come from shelling-out many times during
a Puppet run), ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that. And finally, <code>puppet resource</code> is a
REALLY handy tool for querying the current state of your resources on a system.
These problems all have solutions, but up until recently there was just one more
problem:</p>

<p><strong>Good luck finding documentation for those solutions.</strong></p>

<p>NOTE: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Puppet-Types-Providers-Dan-Bode/dp/1449339328/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387136838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=types+and+providers+puppet+book">Puppet Types and Providers book written by Nan and Dan</a>
is a great resource that provides a bit of a deeper dive than I&rsquo;ll be doing in this
post &ndash; DO check it out if you want to know more</p>

<h2>Something, something, <code>puppet resource</code></h2>

<p>The <code>puppet resource</code> command (or <code>ralsh</code>, as it used to be known), is a very
handy command for querying a system and returning the current state of resources
for a specific Puppet type.  Try it out if you never have (note that the following
is being run on CentOS 6.4):</p>

<pre><code>[root@linux ~]# puppet resource user
user { 'abrt':
  ensure           =&gt; 'present',
  gid              =&gt; '173',
  home             =&gt; '/etc/abrt',
  password         =&gt; '!!',
  password_max_age =&gt; '-1',
  password_min_age =&gt; '-1',
  shell            =&gt; '/sbin/nologin',
  uid              =&gt; '173',
}
user { 'adm':
  ensure           =&gt; 'present',
  comment          =&gt; 'adm',
  gid              =&gt; '4',
  groups           =&gt; ['sys', 'adm'],
  home             =&gt; '/var/adm',
  password         =&gt; '*',
  password_max_age =&gt; '99999',
  password_min_age =&gt; '0',
  shell            =&gt; '/sbin/nologin',
  uid              =&gt; '3',
}
&lt; ... and more users below ... &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>puppet resource</code> command returns a list of all users on the system
and their current property values (note you can only see the password
hash if you&rsquo;re running Puppet with sufficient privileges). You can even
query <code>puppet resource</code> for the values of a specific resource:</p>

<pre><code>[root@gary ~]# puppet resource user glarizza
user { 'glarizza':
  ensure           =&gt; 'present',
  gid              =&gt; '502',
  home             =&gt; '/home/glarizza',
  password         =&gt; '$1$hsUuCygh$kgLKG5epuRaXHMX5KmxrL1',
  password_max_age =&gt; '99999',
  password_min_age =&gt; '0',
  shell            =&gt; '/bin/bash',
  uid              =&gt; '502',
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>puppet resource</code> seems magical, and you might think that if you create a
custom type and sync it to your machine then <code>puppet resource</code> will automatically
work for you.</p>

<p><strong>And you would be wrong.</strong></p>

<p><code>puppet resource</code> will only work if you&rsquo;ve implemented a special method in your
provider called <code>self.instances</code>.</p>

<h2><code>self.instances</code></h2>

<p>The <code>self.instances</code> method is pretty sparsely documented, so let&rsquo;s go straight
to the source&hellip;code, that is:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find that method around lines 348 &ndash; 377 of the <code>lib/puppet/provider.rb</code>
file in Puppet&rsquo;s source code (as of this writing, which is a Friday&hellip;
on a flight from DC to Seattle). To summarize, implementing <code>self.instances</code>
in your provider means that you need to return an array of provider instances
that have been discovered on the current system and all the current property
values (we call these values the &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for the properties, since each
value IS the current value of the property on the system). It&rsquo;s recommended to only
implement <code>self.instances</code> if you can gather all resource property values in a reasonably
&lsquo;cheap&rsquo; manner (i.e. a single system call, read from a single file, or some
similar low-IO means). Implementing <code>self.instances</code> not only gives you the
ability to run <code>puppet resource</code> (which also affords you a quick-and-dirty
way of testing your provider without creating unit tests by simply running
<code>puppet resource</code> in debug mode and checking the output), but it also allows
the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#resources">&lsquo;resources&rsquo; resource</a> to work its magic (If you&rsquo;ve
never heard of the &lsquo;resources&rsquo; resource, <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#resources">check this link</a>
for more information on this terribly/awesomely named resource type).</p>

<h3>An important note about scope and <code>self.instances</code></h3>

<p>The <code>self.instances</code> method is a method of the PROVIDER, which is why it is
prefixed with <code>self.</code>  Even though it may be located in the provider file
itself, and even though it sits among other methods like <code>create</code>, <code>exists?</code>,
and <code>destroy</code> (which are methods of the INSTANCE of the provider), it does
NOT have the ability to directly access or call those methods. It DOES have
the ability to access other methods of the provider directly (i.e. other
methods prefixed with <code>self.</code>).  This means that if you were to define a
method like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">proxy_type</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s1">&#39;web&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You could access that directly from <code>self.instances</code> by simply calling it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">type_of_proxy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">proxy_type</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s say you had a method of the INSTANCE of the provider, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">system_type</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s1">&#39;OS X&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You COULD NOT access this method from <code>self.instances</code> directly (there are
always hacky ways around EVERYTHING in Ruby, sure, but there is no easy/straightforward
way to access this method).</p>

<p><strong>And here&rsquo;s where it gets confusing&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Methods of the INSTANCE of the provider CAN access provider methods directly.
Given our previous example, what if the <code>system_type</code> method wanted to access
<code>self.proxy_type</code> for some reason?  It could be done like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">system_type</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">type_of_proxy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">proxy_type</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s1">&#39;OS X&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A method of the instance of the provider can access provider methods by simply
calling the <code>class</code> method on itself (which returns the provider object). This
is a one-way street for method creation that needs to be heeded when designing
your provider.</p>

<h2>Building a provider that uses <code>self.instances</code> (or: more Mac problems)</h2>

<p>In the previous two posts on types/providers, I created a type and provider
for managing bypass domains for network proxies on OS X. For this post, let&rsquo;s
create a provider for actually MANAGING the proxy settings for a given
network interface.  Here&rsquo;s a quick type for managing a web proxy on a network
interface on OS X:</p>

<p>This type has three properties, is ensurable, and a namevar called &lsquo;name&rsquo;. As
for the provider, let&rsquo;s start with <code>self.instances</code> and get the web proxy
values for all interfaces.  To do that we&rsquo;re going to need to know how to get
a list of all network interfaces, and also how to get the current proxy state
for every interface. Fortunately, both of those tasks are accomplished with the
<code>networksetup</code> binary:</p>

<pre><code>▷ networksetup -listallnetworkservices
An asterisk (*) denotes that a network service is disabled.
Bluetooth DUN
Display Ethernet
Ethernet
FireWire
Wi-Fi
iPhone USB
Bluetooth PAN

▷ networksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet
Enabled: No
Server: proxy.corp.net
Port: 1234
Authenticated Proxy Enabled: 0
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, so one binary will do both tasks and they&rsquo;re REASONABLY low-cost to run.</p>

<h3>Helper methods</h3>

<p>To keep things separated and easier to test, let&rsquo;s create separate helper methods
for each task. Since these methods are going to be called by <code>self.instances</code>,
they will be provider methods.</p>

<p>The first method will simply return an array of network interfaces:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">get_list_of_interfaces</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">interfaces</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">networksetup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;-listallnetworkservices&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">interfaces</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shift</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">interfaces</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Remember from above that the <code>networksetup -listallnetworkservices</code> command
returns an info line before each interface, so this code strips that line
off and returns a sorted list of interfaces based on a one-line-per-interface
assumption.</p>

<p>The next method we need will accept a network interface name as an argument,
will run the <code>networksetup -getwebproxy (interface)</code> command, and will use
its output to return all the current property values (including the ensure
value) for every instance of the type on the system (i.e. every interface&rsquo;s
proxy settings and whether the proxy is enabled, which means the resource
is ensured as &lsquo;present&rsquo;, or disabled, which means the resource is ensured
as &lsquo;absent&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A couple of notes on the method itself &ndash; first, the <code>networksetup</code> command must
exit zero on success or non-zero on failure (which it does). If ever the <code>networksetup</code>
command were to return non-zero, we&rsquo;re raising our own Puppet::Error, documenting what
happened, and bailing out.</p>

<p>This method is going to return a hash of properties and values that is going
to be used by <code>self.instances</code> &ndash; so the case statement needs to account for that.
HOWEVER you populate that hash is up to you (in my case, I&rsquo;m checking for specific
output that <code>networksetup</code> returns), but make sure that the hash has a value for
the <code>:ensure</code> key at the VERY least.</p>

<h3>Assembling <code>self.instances</code></h3>

<p>Once the helper provider methods have been defined, <code>self.instances</code> becomes
reasonably simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">instances</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">get_list_of_interfaces</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collect</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">int</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">proxy_properties</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_proxy_properties</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">int</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kp">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">proxy_properties</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Remember that <code>self.instances</code> must return an array of provider instances,
and each one of these instances must include the <code>namevar</code> and ensure value
at the very least. Since <code>self.get_proxy_properties</code> returns a hash containing
all the property &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for a resource, declaring a new provider instance
is as easy as calling the <code>new()</code> method on the return value of
<code>self.get_proxy_properties</code> for every network interface. In the end, the
return value of the <code>collect</code> method on <code>get_list_of_interfaces</code> will be an
array of provider instances.</p>

<h2>Existance, <code>@property_hash</code>, and more magical methods</h2>

<p>Even though we have assembled a functional <code>self.instances</code> method, we don&rsquo;t have
complete implementation that will work with <code>puppet resource</code>.  The problem is
that Puppet can&rsquo;t yet determine the existance of a resource (even though the
resource&rsquo;s <code>ensure</code> value has been set by <code>self.instances</code>). If you were to
execute the code with <code>puppet resource mac_web_proxy</code>, you would get the error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Could not run: No ability to determine if mac_web_proxy exists
</code></pre>

<p>To satisfy Puppet, we need to implement an <code>exists?()</code> method for the instance
of the provider. Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t need to re-implement any existing logic
and can instead use <code>@property_hash</code></p>

<h3>A <code>@property_hash</code> is born&hellip;</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve omitted one last thing that is borne out of <code>self.instances</code>, and that&rsquo;s
the <code>@property_hash</code> instance variable. <code>@property_hash</code> is populated by
<code>self.instances</code> as an instance variable that&rsquo;s available to methods of the
INSTANCE of the provider (i.e. methods that ARE NOT prefixed with <code>self.</code>)
containing all the &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for a resource. Do you need to get the &lsquo;is&rsquo;
value for a property?  Just use <code>@property_hash[:property_name]</code>. Since the
<code>exists?</code> method is a method of the instance of the provider, and it&rsquo;s
essentially the same thing as the <code>ensure</code> value for a resource, let&rsquo;s implement
<code>exists?</code> by doing a check on the ensure value from the <code>@property_hash</code>
variable:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">exists?</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="vi">@property_hash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:ensure</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="ss">:present</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Perfect, now <code>exists?</code> will return true or false accordingly and Puppet will be
satisfied.</p>

<h3>Getter methods &ndash; the slow way</h3>

<p>Puppet may be happy that you have an <code>exists?</code> method, but <code>puppet resource</code>
won&rsquo;t successfully run until you have a method that returns an &lsquo;is&rsquo; value for
every property of the type (i.e. the <code>proxy_server</code>, <code>proxy_authenticated</code>,
and <code>proxy_port</code> attributes for the mac_web_proxy type). These &lsquo;is value methods&rsquo; are
called &lsquo;getter&rsquo; methods: they&rsquo;re methods of the instance of the provider, and
are named exactly the same as the properties they represent.</p>

<p>You SHOULD be thinking: &ldquo;Hey, we already have <code>@property_hash</code>, why can&rsquo;t we
just use it again? We can, and you COULD implement all the getter methods
like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">proxy_server</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="vi">@property_hash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:proxy_server</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you did that, you would be TECHNICALLY correct, but it would seem to be a
waste of lines in a provider (especially if you have many properties).</p>

<h3>Getter methods &ndash; the quicker &lsquo;method&rsquo;</h3>

<p>Because uncle Luke hated excess lines of code, he made available a method called
<code>mk_resource_methods</code> which works very similarly to Ruby&rsquo;s <code>attr_accessor</code>
method. Adding <code>mk_resource_methods</code> to your provider will AUTOMATICALLY
create getter methods that pull values out of <code>@property_hash</code> in the similar
way that I just demonstrated (it will also create SETTER methods too, but we&rsquo;ll
look at those later). Long story short &ndash; don&rsquo;t make getter/setter methods if
you&rsquo;re using self.instances &ndash; just implement <code>mk_resource_methods</code>.</p>

<h2>JUST enough for <code>puppet resource</code></h2>

<p>Putting everything that we&rsquo;ve learned up until now, we should have a provider
that looks like this:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a tree of the module I&rsquo;ve assembled on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>└(~/src/puppet-mac_web_proxy)▷ tree .

       │       └── ruby.rb
       └── type
           └── mac_web_proxy.rb
</code></pre>

<p>To test out <code>puppet resource</code>, we need to make Puppet aware of our new custom
module. To do that, let&rsquo;s set the <code>$RUBYLIB</code> environmental variable. <code>$RUBYLIB</code>
is queried by Puppet and is added to its load path when looking for additional
Puppet plugins.  You will need to set <code>$RUBYLIB</code> to the path of the <code>lib</code> directory
in the custom module that you&rsquo;ve assembled.  Because my custom module is located
in <code>~/src/puppet-mac_web_proxy</code>, I&rsquo;m going to set <code>$RUBYLIB</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>export RUBYLIB=~/src/puppet-mac_web_proxy/lib
</code></pre>

<p>You can execute that command from the command line, or set it in your
<code>~/.{bash,zsh}rc</code> and <code>source</code> that file.</p>

<p>Finally, with all the files in place and <code>$RUBYLIB</code> set, it&rsquo;s time to officially
run <code>puppet resource</code> (I&rsquo;m going to do it in <code>--debug</code> mode to see the debug output
that I&rsquo;ve written into the code):</p>

<p>Note that you will only see &lsquo;is&rsquo; values if you have a proxy set on any of your
network interfaces (obviously, if you&rsquo;ve not setup a proxy, then it will show
as &lsquo;absent&rsquo; on every interface. You can setup a proxy by opening System
Preferences, clicking on the Network icon, choosing an interface from the list
on the left, clicking the Advanced button in the lower right corner of the
window, clicking the &lsquo;Proxies&#8221; tab at the top of the window, clicking the
checkbox next to the &ldquo;Web Proxy (HTTP)&rdquo; choice, and entering a proxy URL and
port. NOW do you get why we automate this bullshit?).  Also, your list of
network interfaces may not match mine if you have more or less interfaces than
I do.</p>

<p>TADA! <code>puppet resource</code> WORKS! ISN&rsquo;T THAT AWESOME?! WHY AM I TYPING IN CAPS?!</p>

<h2>Prefetching, flushing, caching, and other hard shit</h2>

<p>Okay, so up until now we&rsquo;ve implemented one half of the equation &ndash; we can query
&lsquo;is&rsquo; values and <code>puppet resource</code> works. What about using this &lsquo;more efficient&rsquo;
method of getting values for a type on the OTHER end of the spectrum? What if
instead of calling setter methods one-by-one to set values for all resources
of a type in a catalog we had a way to do it all at once? Well, such a way
exists, and it&rsquo;s called the <code>flush</code> method&hellip;but we&rsquo;re getting slightly ahead
of ourselves. Before we get to flushing, we need to point out that <code>self.instances</code>
is ONLY used by <code>puppet resource</code> &ndash; THAT&rsquo;S IT (and it&rsquo;s only used by <code>self.instances</code>
when you GET values from the system, not when you SET values on the system&hellip;and if
you never knew that <code>puppet resource</code> could actually SET values on the system, well,
I guess you got another surprise today). If we want <code>puppet agent</code> or
<code>puppet apply</code> to use the behavior that <code>self.instances</code> implements, we need
to create another method: <code>self.prefetch</code></p>

<h3><code>self.prefetch</code></h3>

<p>If you thought <code>self.instances</code> didn&rsquo;t have much documentation, wait until
you see <code>self.prefetch</code>.  After wading the waters of <code>self.prefetch</code>, I&rsquo;m
PRETTY SURE its implementation might have come to uncle Luke after a long
night in Reed&rsquo;s chem lab where he might have accidently synthesized mescaline.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, documentation for <code>self.prefetch</code> in the Puppet codebase is
9 lines of comments in <code>lib/puppet/provider.rb</code>, which is awesome. So when
is <code>self.prefetch</code> used to provide information to Puppet and when is <code>self.instances</code> used?</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that <code>self.instances</code> is really only handy for <code>puppet
resource</code> &ndash; that&rsquo;s definitely not the case.  In fact, frequently you will find
that <code>self.instances</code> is used by <code>self.prefetch</code> to do some of the heavy
lifting.  Even though <code>self.prefetch</code> works VERY SIMILARLY to the way that
<code>self.instances</code> works for <code>puppet resource</code> (and by that I mean that it&rsquo;s
going to gather a list of instances of a type on the system, and it&rsquo;s also
going to populate <code>@property_hash</code> for <code>puppet apply</code>, <code>puppet agent</code>, and when
when <code>puppet resource</code> is setting values), it&rsquo;s not an exact one-for-one match
with <code>self.instances</code>.  The <code>self.prefetch</code> method for a type is called once
per run when Puppet encounters a resource of that type in the catalog. The
argument to <code>self.prefetch</code> is a hash of all managed resources of that type
that are encountered in a compiled catalog for that node (the hash&rsquo;s key will
be the <code>namevar</code> of the resource, and the value will be an instance of
<code>Puppet::Type</code> &ndash; in this case, <code>Puppet::Type::Mac_web_proxy</code>).  Your task is to
implement a <code>self.prefetch</code> method that gets an array of instances of the
provider that are discovered on the system, iterates through the hash passed to
<code>self.prefetch</code> (containing all the resources of the type that were discovered
in the catalog), and passes the correct instance of the provider that was
discovered on the system to the <code>provider=</code> method of the correct instance of
the type that was discovered in the catalog.</p>

<p><strong>What the actual fuck?!</strong></p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s break that apart to try and discover exactly what&rsquo;s going on here.
Assume that I&rsquo;ve setup a proxy for the &lsquo;FireWire&rsquo; interface on my laptop, and
I want to try and manage that resource with <code>puppet apply</code> (i.e. something that
uses <code>self.prefetch</code>). The resource in the manifest used to manage the proxy
will look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='puppet'><span class='line'><span class="nc">mac_web_proxy</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s1">&#39;firewire&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">ensure</span>       <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;present&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">proxy_port</span>   <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;8080&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">proxy_server</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;proxy.server.org&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When <code>self.prefetch</code> is called by Puppet, it&rsquo;s going to be passed a hash looking
something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">&quot;firewire&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">Mac_web_proxy</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">firewire</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Because only one resource is encountered in the catalog, only one key/value
pair shows up in the hash that&rsquo;s passed as the argument to <code>self.prefetch</code>.</p>

<p>The job of <code>self.prefetch</code> is to find the current state of <code>Mac_web_proxy['firewire']</code>
on the system, create a new instance of the <code>mac_web_proxy</code> provider that contains
the &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for the <code>Mac_web_proxy['firewire']</code> resource, and assign this provider instance as the value
of the <code>provider=</code> method to the instance of the mac_web_proxy TYPE that is the
VALUE of the &lsquo;firewire&rsquo; key of the hash that&rsquo;s passed to <code>self.prefetch</code>.</p>

<p><strong>No, really, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. I&rsquo;m not even sure what&rsquo;s real anymore</strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll remember that <code>self.instances</code> gives us an array of resources that were
discovered on the system, so we have THAT part of the implementation written. We also have the
hash of resources that were encountered in the catalog &ndash; so we have THAT
part done too. Our only job is to connect the dots (la la la la), programmatically
speaking.  This should just about do it:</p>

<p>I want to make a confession right now &ndash; I&rsquo;ve only ever copied and pasted this
code into every provider I&rsquo;ve ever written that needed <code>self.prefetch</code> implemented.
It wasn&rsquo;t until someone actually asked me what it DID that I had to walk the path
of figuring out EXACTLY what it did. Based on the last couple of paragraphs &ndash; can
you blame me?</p>

<p>This code iterates through the array of resources returned by <code>self.instances</code>,
tries to assign a variable <code>resource</code> based on referencing a key in the
<code>resources</code> hash using the name of the resource (remember, <code>resources</code> is
a hash containing all resources in the catalog), and, if this assignment works
(i.e. it isn&rsquo;t <code>nil</code>, which is what happens when you reference a key in a Ruby
hash that doesn&rsquo;t exist), then we&rsquo;re calling the <code>provider=</code> method on the
instance of the type that was referenced in the <code>resources</code> hash, and passing
it the resource that was discovered on the system by <code>self.instances</code>.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Why <strong>DID</strong> we do all of that?  We did it all for the <code>@provider_hash</code>. Doing
this will populate <code>@provider_hash</code> in all methods of the instance of the
provider (i.e. <code>exists?</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>destroy</code>, etc..) just like <code>self.instances</code>
did for <code>puppet resource</code>.</p>

<h2>Flush it; Ship it</h2>

<p>As I alluded to above, the opposite side of the coin to prefetching (which
is a way to query the state for all resources at once) is flushing (or
specifically the <code>flush</code> method). The <code>flush</code> method is called once per
resource whenever the &lsquo;is&rsquo; and &lsquo;should&rsquo; values for a property differ (and
synchronization needs to occur). The <code>flush</code> method <strong>does not take the place
of property setter methods</strong>, but, rather, is used in conjunction with them
to determine how to synchronize resource property values. In this vein, it&rsquo;s
a single trigger that can be used to set all property values for an individual
resource simultaneously.</p>

<p>There are a couple of strategies for implementing <code>flush</code>, but one of the more
popular ones in use is to create an instance variable that will hold values to
be synchronized, and then determine inside <code>flush</code> how best to make
as-few-as-possible calls to the system to synchronize all the property values
for an individual resource.</p>

<p>Our resource type is unique because the <code>networksetup</code> binary that we&rsquo;ll be
using to synchronize values allows us to set most every property value with
a single command. Because of this, we really only need that instance variable
for one property &ndash; the ensure value.  But let&rsquo;s start with the initialization
of that instance variable for the <code>flush</code> method:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{})</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="vi">@property_flush</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>initialize</code> method is magic to Ruby &ndash; it&rsquo;s invoked when you instantiate
a new object. In our case, we want to create a new instance variable &ndash;
<code>@property_flush</code> &ndash; that will be available to all methods of the instance of
the provider. This instance variable will be a hash and will contain all the
&lsquo;should&rsquo; values that will need to be synchronized for a resource. The <code>super</code>
method in Ruby sends a message to the parent of the current object, asking it
to invoke a method of the same name (e.g. <code>intialize</code>).  Basically, the
<code>initialize</code> method is doing the exact same thing as it has always done with
one exception &ndash; making the instance variable available to all methods of the
instance of the provider.</p>

<h3>The only &lsquo;setter&rsquo; method you need</h3>

<p>This provider is going to be unique not only because the <code>networksetup</code>
binary will set values for ALL properties, but because to change/set ANY
property values you have to change/set ALL the property values at the same
time. Typically, you&rsquo;ll see providers that will need to pass arguments to
a binary in order to set individual values.  For example, if you had a
binary <code>fooset</code> that took arguments of <code>--bar</code> and <code>--baz</code> to set values
respectively for <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code> properties of a resource, you might see the following
setter and flush methods for <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code>:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the case for <code>networksetup</code> &ndash; in fact, one of the ONLY places in our code
where we&rsquo;re going to throw a value inside <code>@property_flush</code> is going to be in
the <code>destroy</code> method. If our intention is to ensure a proxy absent (or, in
this case, disable the proxy for a network interface), then we can short-circuit
the method we&rsquo;re going to create to set proxy values by simply checking for
a value in <code>@property_flush[:ensure]</code>. Here&rsquo;s what the <code>destroy</code> method looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, we need a method that will set values for our proxy. This method will
handle all interaction to <code>networksetup</code>.  So, how do you set proxy values
with <code>networksetup</code>?</p>

<pre><code>networksetup -setwebproxy &lt;networkservice&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;port number&gt; &lt;authenticated&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The three properties to our <code>mac_web_proxy</code> type are <code>proxy_port</code>, <code>proxy_server</code>,
and <code>proxy_authenticated</code> which map to the &lsquo;&lt;port number>&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lt;domain>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;&lt;authenticated>&rsquo; values in this command. To change any of these values
means we have to pass ALL of these values (again, which is why our <code>flush</code>
implementation may be unique from other <code>flush</code> implementations). Here&rsquo;s what
the <code>set_proxy</code> method looks like:</p>

<p>This helper method does all the validation checks for required properties,
executes the correct command, and enables the proxy. Now, let&rsquo;s implement
<code>flush</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">flush</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">set_proxy</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># Collect the resources again once they&#39;ve been changed (that way `puppet</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># resource` will show the correct values after changes have been made).</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="vi">@property_hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_proxy_properties</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">resource</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last line re-populates <code>@property_hash</code> with the current resource values,
and is necessary for <code>puppet resource</code> to return correct values after it
makes a change to a resource during a run.</p>

<h3>The final method</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve implemented logic to query the state of all resources, to prefetch those
states, to make changes to all properties at once, and to destroy a resource
if it exists, but we&rsquo;ve yet to implement logic to CREATE a resource if it
doesn&rsquo;t exist and it should.  Well, this is a bit of a lie &ndash; the logic is in
the code, but we don&rsquo;t have a <code>create</code> method, so Puppet&rsquo;s going to complain:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="vi">@property_flush</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:ensure</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:present</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Technically, this method doesn&rsquo;t have to do a DAMN thing. Why? Remember how the
<code>flush</code> method is triggered when a resource&rsquo;s &lsquo;is&rsquo; values differ from its
&lsquo;should&rsquo; values? Also, remember how the <code>flush</code> method only calls the <code>set_proxy</code>
method? And, finally, remember how <code>set_proxy</code> only checks if
<code>@property_flush[:ensure] == :absent</code> (and if it doesn&rsquo;t, then it goes about
its merry way running <code>networksetup</code>)?  Right, well add these things up and
you&rsquo;ll realize that the <code>create</code> method is essentially meaningless based on our
implementation (but if you OMIT <code>create</code>, then Puppet&rsquo;s going to throw a shit-fit
in the shape of of a <code>Puppet::Error</code> exception):</p>

<pre><code>Error: /Mac_web_proxy[firewire]/ensure: change from absent to present failed: Could not set 'present' on ensure: undefined method `create' for Mac_web_proxy[firewire]:Puppet::Type::Mac_web_proxy
</code></pre>

<p>So make Puppet happy and write the goddamn <code>create</code> method, okay?</p>

<h2>The complete provider:</h2>

<p>Wow, that was a wild ride, huh?  If you&rsquo;ve been coding along, you should have
created a file that looks something like this:</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there are better ways to write this Ruby code, no? Also, I&rsquo;m SURE
I have some errors/bugs in that code. It&rsquo;s those things that keep me in a job&hellip;</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>So, I write these posts not to belittle or mock anyone who works on Puppet
or wrote any of its implementation (except the amazing/terrifying bastard who
came up with <code>self.prefetch</code>). Anybody who contributes to open source and who
builds a tool to save some time for a bunch of sysadmins is fucking awesome
in my book.</p>

<p>No, I write these posts so that you can understand the <strong>&lsquo;WHY&rsquo;</strong> piece of the
puzzle. If you fuck up the <strong>&lsquo;HOW&rsquo;</strong> of the code, you can spend some time in
Google and IRB to figure it out, but if you don&rsquo;t understand the <strong>&lsquo;WHY&rsquo;</strong>
then you&rsquo;re probably not going to even bother.</p>

<p>Also, selfishly, I move from project to project so quickly that it&rsquo;s REALLY
easy to forget both why AND how I did what I did. Posts like these give me
someplace to point people when they ask me &ldquo;What&rsquo;s <code>self.prefetch</code>?&rdquo; that
ISN&rsquo;T just the source code or a liquor store.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the last post in the series, by the way. I haven&rsquo;t even TOUCHED
on writing unit tests for this code, so that&rsquo;s going to be a WHOLE other
piece altogether. Also, while this provider manages a <strong>WEB</strong> proxy for
a network interface, understand that there are MANY MORE kinds of proxies
for OS X network interfaces (including socks and gopher!). A future post
will show you how to refactor the above into a parent provider that can
be inherited to allow for code re-use among all the proxy providers that I
need to create.</p>

<p>As always, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to comment, ask questions, or simply bitch
at me both on this blog as well as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/glarizza">on Twitter: @glarizza</a>. Hopefully
this post helped you out and you learned a little bit more about how Puppet
providers do their dirty work&hellip;</p>

<p>Namaste, bitches.</p>
