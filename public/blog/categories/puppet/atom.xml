    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://www.garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/17/puppet-workflow-part-1/">first post</a>, I talked about writing functional component
modules. Well, I didn&rsquo;t really do much detailing other than pointing out
key bits of information that tend to cause problems. In this post, I&rsquo;ll
describe the next layer to the functional Puppet module workflow.</p>

<p>People usually stop once they have a library of component modules (whether
hand-written, taken from Github, or pulled from <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com">The Forge</a>). The idea
is that you can classify all of your nodes in <code>site.pp</code>, the Puppet
Enterprise Console, The Foreman, or with some other ENC, so why not just
declare all your classes for every node when you need them?</p>

<p>Because that&rsquo;s a lot of extra work and opportunities for fuckups.</p>

<p>People recognized this, so in the EARLY days of Puppet they would create node
blocks in <code>site.pp</code> and use inheritance to inherit from those blocks. This was
the right IDEA, but probably not the best PLACE for it. Eventually, &lsquo;Profiles&rsquo;
were born.</p>

<p>The idea of &lsquo;Roles and Profiles&rsquo; originally came from a piece that
<a href="http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/">Craig Dunn wrote</a> while he worked for the BBC, and then
<a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2012/12/day-13-configuration-management-as-legos.html">Adrien Thebo also wrote a piece</a> that documents the same sort of pattern.
So why am I writing about it a THIRD time? Well, because I feel it&rsquo;s only a PIECE
of an overall puzzle. The introduction of Hiera and other awesome tools (like R10k,
which we will get to on the next post) still make Roles and Profiles VIABLE, but
they also extend upon them.</p>

<p>One final note before we move on &ndash; the terms &lsquo;Roles&rsquo; and &lsquo;Profiles&rsquo; are ENTIRELY
ARBITRARY. They&rsquo;re not magic reserve words in Puppet, and you can call them
whatever the hell you want. It&rsquo;s also been pointed out that Craig MIGHT have
misnamed them (a ROLE should be a model for an individual piece of tech, and a
PROFILE should probably be a group of roles), but, like all good Puppet Labs
employees &ndash; we suck at naming things.</p>

<h2>Profiles: technology-specific wrapper classes</h2>

<p>A profile is simply a wrapper class that groups Hiera lookups and class
declarations into one functional unit. For example, if you wanted Wordpress
installed on a machine, you&rsquo;d probably need to declare the apache class to
get Apache setup, declare an <code>apache::vhost</code> for the Wordpress directory,
setup a MySQL database with the appropriate classes, and so on. There are
a lot of components that go together when you setup a piece of technology,
it&rsquo;s not just a single class.</p>

<p>Because of this, a profile exists to give you a single class you can include
that will setup all the necessary bits for that piece of technology (be it
Wordpress, or Tomcat, or whatever).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a simple profile for Wordpress:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet profiles/manifests/wordpress.pp %}
class profiles::wordpress {</p>

<p>  ## Hiera lookups
  $site_name               = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::site_name&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_user_password = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_user_password&rsquo;)
  $mysql_root_password     = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::mysql_root_password&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_db_host       = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_db_host&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_db_name       = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_db_name&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_db_password   = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_db_password&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_user          = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_user&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_group         = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_group&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_docroot       = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_docroot&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_port          = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_port&rsquo;)</p>

<p>  ## Create user
  group { &lsquo;wordpress&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>ensure =&gt; present,
name   =&gt; $wordpress_group,
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  user { &lsquo;wordpress&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>ensure   =&gt; present,
gid      =&gt; $wordpress_group,
password =&gt; $wordpress_user_password,
name     =&gt; $wordpress_group,
home     =&gt; $wordpress_docroot,
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  ## Configure mysql
  class { &lsquo;mysql::server&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>root_password =&gt; $wordpress_root_password,
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  class { &lsquo;mysql::bindings&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>php_enable =&gt; true,
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  ## Configure apache
  include apache
  include apache::mod::php
  apache::vhost { $::fqdn:</p>

<pre><code>port    =&gt; $wordpress_port,
docroot =&gt; $wordpress_docroot,
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  ## Configure wordpress
  class { &lsquo;::wordpress&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>install_dir =&gt; $wordpress_docroot,
db_name     =&gt; $wordpress_db_name,
db_host     =&gt; $wordpress_db_host,
db_password =&gt; $wordpress_db_password,
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<h3>Name your profiles according to the technology they setup</h3>

<p>Profiles are technology-specific, so you&rsquo;ll have one to setup wordpress, and
tomcat, and jenkins, and&hellip;well, you get the picture. You can also namespace
your profiles so that you have <code>profiles::ssh::server</code> and
<code>profiles::ssh::client</code> if you want. You can even have
<code>profiles::jenkins::tomcat</code> and <code>profiles::jenkins::jboss</code> or however you need
to namespace according to the TECHNOLOGIES you use. You don&rsquo;t need to include
your environment in the profile name (a la <code>profiles::dev::tomcat</code>) as the bits
of data that make the dev environment different from production should come
from <strong>HIERA</strong>, and thus aren&rsquo;t going to be different on a per-profile basis.
You CAN setup profiles according to your business unit if multiple units use
Puppet and have different setups (a la <code>security::profiles::tomcat</code> versus
<code>ops::profiles::tomcat</code>), but the GOAL of Puppet is to have one main set of
modules that every group uses (and the Hiera data being different for every
group). That&rsquo;s the GOAL, but I&rsquo;m pragmatic enough to understand that not
everywhere is a shiny, happy &lsquo;DevOps Garden.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>Do all Hiera lookups in the profile</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see that I declared variables and set their values with Hiera lookups.
The profile is the place for these lookups because the profile collects all
external data and declares all the classes you&rsquo;ll need. In reality, you&rsquo;ll
<strong>USUALLY</strong> only see profiles looking up parameters and declaring classes
(i.e. declaring users and groups like I did above will USUALLY be left to
component classes).</p>

<p>I do the Hiera lookups first to make it easy to debug from where those values
came. I don&rsquo;t rely on <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/puppet.html#automatic-parameter-lookup">&lsquo;Automatic Parameter Lookup&rsquo;</a> in Puppet
3.x.x because it can be &lsquo;magic&rsquo; for people who aren&rsquo;t aware of it (for people
new to Puppet, it&rsquo;s much easier to see a function call and trace back what it
does rather than experience Puppet doing something unseen and wondering what
the hell happened).</p>

<p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll notice that my Hiera lookups have <strong>NO DEFAULT VALUES</strong> &ndash; this
is <strong>BY DESIGN!</strong>  For most people, their Hiera data is <strong>PROBABLY</strong> located in
a separate repository as their Puppet module data. Imagine making a change to
your profile to have it lookup a bit of data from Hiera, and then imagine you
FORGOT to put that data into Hiera. What happens if you provide a default value
to Hiera? The catalog compiles, that default value gets passed down to the
component module, and gets enforced on disk. If you have good tests, you MIGHT
see that the component you configured has a bit of data that&rsquo;s not correct, but
what if you don&rsquo;t have a great post-Puppet testing workflow? Puppet will
correctly set this default value, according to Puppet everything is green and
worked just fine, but now your component is setup incorrectly. That&rsquo;s one of
the WORST failures &ndash; the ones that you don&rsquo;t catch.  Now, imagine you DON&rsquo;T
provide a default value. In THIS case, Puppet will raise a compilation error
because a Hiera lookup didn&rsquo;t return a value. You&rsquo;ll catch your error before
anything gets pushed to Production and you can catch the screwup. This is
a MUCH better solution.</p>

<h3>Use parameterized class declarations and explicitly pass values you care about</h3>

<p>The parameterized class declaration syntax can be dangerous. The difference
between the <code>include</code> function and the parameterized class syntax is that
the <code>include</code> function is idempotent. You can do the following in a Puppet
manifest, and Puppet doesn&rsquo;t raise an error:</p>

<p><code>
include apache
include apache
include apache
</code></p>

<p>This is because the <code>include</code> function checks to see if the class is in the
catalog. If it ISN&rsquo;T, then it adds it. If it IS, then it exits cleanly. The
<code>include</code> function is your pal.</p>

<p>Consider THIS manifest:</p>

<p><code>
class { 'apache': }
include apache
include apache
</code></p>

<p>Does this work?  Yep.  The parameterized class syntax adds the class to the
catalog, the include function detects this and exits cleanly twice.  What
about THIS manifest:</p>

<p><code>
include apache
class { 'apache': }
include apache
</code></p>

<p>Does THIS work?  Nope!  Puppet raises a compilation error because a class was
declared more than once in a catalog.  Why?  Well, consider that Puppet is
&lsquo;declarative&rsquo;&hellip;all the way up until it isn&rsquo;t.  Puppet&rsquo;s PARSER reads from the
top of the file to the bottom of the file, and we have a single-pass parser
when it comes to things like setting variables and declaring classes. When
the parser hits the first include function, it adds the class to the catalog.
The parameterized class syntax, however, is a honey badger: it doesn&rsquo;t give
a shit. It adds a class to the catalog regardless of whether it already exists
or not. So why would we EVER use the parameterized class declaration syntax?
We need to use it because the include function doesn&rsquo;t allow you to pass
parameters when you declare a class.</p>

<p>So wait &ndash; why did I spend all this time explaining why the parameterized class
syntax is more dangerous than the include function <strong>ONLY</strong> to recommend its
use in profiles?  For two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to use it to pass parameters to classes</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re wrapping its use in a class that we can <strong>IN TURN</strong> declare with the <code>include</code> function</li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, we can get the best of BOTH worlds, the ability to pass parameters and
the use of our pal the <code>include</code> function, with this wrapper class. We&rsquo;ll see
the latter usage when we come to roles, but for now let&rsquo;s focus on passing
parameter values.</p>

<p>In the first section, we set variables with Hiera lookups, now we can pass
those variables to classes we&rsquo;re declaring with the parameterized class syntax.
This allows the declaration of the class to be static, but the parameters we
pass to that class to change according to the Hiera hierarchy. We&rsquo;ve explicitly
called the <code>hiera</code> function, so it makes it easier to debug, and we&rsquo;re explicitly
passing parameter values so we know definitively which parameters are being
passed (and thus are overriding default values) to the component module. Finally,
since our component modules do NOT use Hiera at all, we can be sure that if we&rsquo;re
not passing a parameter that it&rsquo;s getting its value from the default set in the
module&rsquo;s <code>::params</code> class.</p>

<p>Everything we do here is meant to make things easier to debug when it&rsquo;s 3am and
things aren&rsquo;t working. Any asshole can do crazy shit in Puppet, but a seasoned
sysadmin writes their code for ease of debugging during 3am pages.</p>

<h3>An annoying Puppet bug &ndash; top-level class declarations and profiles</h3>

<p><a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/2053">Oh, ticket 2053</a>, how terrible are you? This is one of those bug numbers
that I can remember by heart (like <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/8040">8040</a> and <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/86">86</a>). Puppet has
the ability to do &lsquo;relative namespacing&rsquo;, which allows you to declare a variable
called <code>$port</code> in a class called <code>$apache</code> and refer to it as <code>$port</code> instead
of fully-namespacing the variable, and thus having to call it <code>$apache::port</code>
inside the <code>apache</code> class. It&rsquo;s a shortcut &ndash; you can STILL refer to the variable
as <code>$apache::port</code> in the class &ndash; but it comes in handy. The PROBLEM occurs when
you create a profile, as we did above, called <code>profiles::wordpress</code> and you try
to declare a class called <code>wordpress</code>.  If you do the following inside the
<code>profiles::wordpress</code> class, what class is being declared:</p>

<p><code>
include wordpress
</code></p>

<p>If you think you&rsquo;re declaring a wordpress class from within a wordpress module
in your Puppet modulepath, you would be wrong.  Puppet ACTUALLY thinks you&rsquo;re
trying to declare <code>profiles::wordpress</code> because you&rsquo;re INSIDE the <code>profiles::wordpress</code>
class and it&rsquo;s doing relative namespacing (i.e. in the same way you refer to <code>$port</code>
and ACTUALLY mean <code>$apache::port</code> it thinks you&rsquo;re referring to <code>wordpress</code> and
ACTUALLY mean <code>profiles::wordpress</code>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this causes LOTS of confusion.</p>

<p>The solution here is to declare a class called <code>::wordpress</code> which tells Puppet
to go to the top-level namespace and look for a module called <code>wordpress</code> which
has a top-level class called <code>wordpress</code>. It&rsquo;s the same reason that we refer to
Facter Fact values as <code>$::osfamily</code> instead of <code>$osfamily</code> in class definitions
(because you can declare a local variable called <code>$osfamily</code> in your class).
This is why in the profile above you see this:</p>

<p><code>
class { '::wordpress':
  install_dir =&gt; $wordpress_docroot,
  db_name     =&gt; $wordpress_db_name,
  db_host     =&gt; $wordpress_db_host,
  db_password =&gt; $wordpress_db_password,
}
</code></p>

<p>When you use profiles and roles, you&rsquo;ll need to do this namespacing trick when
declaring classes because you&rsquo;re frequently going to have a <code>profile::&lt;sometech&gt;</code>
that will declare the <code>&lt;sometech&gt;</code> top-level class.</p>

<h2>Roles: business-specific wrapper classes</h2>

<p>How do you refer to your machines? When I ask you about that cluster over
there, do you say &ldquo;Oh, you mean the machines with java 1.6, apache, mysql,
etc&hellip;&rdquo;?  I didn&rsquo;t think so. You usually have names for them, like the
&ldquo;internal compute cluster&rdquo; or &ldquo;app builder nodes&rdquo; or &ldquo;DMZ repo machines&rdquo; or
whatever. These names are your Roles. Roles are just the mapping of your
machine&rsquo;s names to the technology that should be ON them. In the past we had
descriptive hostnames that afforded us a code for what the machine &lsquo;did&rsquo; &ndash;
roles are just that mapping for Puppet.</p>

<p>Roles are namespaced just like profiles, but now it&rsquo;s up to your organization
to fill in the blanks. Some people immediately want to put environments into
the roles (a la <code>roles::uat::compute_cluster</code>), but that&rsquo;s usually not necessary
(as MOST LIKELY the compute cluster nodes have the SAME technology on them
when they&rsquo;re in dev versus when they&rsquo;re in prod, it&rsquo;s just the DATA &ndash; like
database names, VIP locations, usernames/passwords, etc &ndash; that&rsquo;s different.
Again, these data differences will come from Hiera, so there should be no reason
to put the environment name in your role). You still CAN put the environment
name in the role if it makes you feel better, but it&rsquo;ll probably be useless.</p>

<h3>Roles ONLY include profiles</h3>

<p>So what exactly is in the role wrapper class? That depends on what technology
is on the node that defines that role. What I can tell you for CERTAIN is that
roles should ONLY use the <code>include</code> function and should ONLY include profiles.
What does this give us? This gives us our pal the <code>include</code> function back! You
can include the same profile 100 times if you want, and Puppet only puts it in
the catalog once.</p>

<h3>Every node is classified with one role. Period.</h3>

<p>The beautiful thing about roles and profiles is that the GOAL is that you
should be able to classify a node with a SINGLE role and THAT&rsquo;S IT. This makes
classification simple and static &ndash; the node gets its role, the role includes
profiles, profiles call out to Hiera for data, that data is passed to component
modules, and away we go. Also, since classification is static, you can use
version control to see what changes were introduced to the role (i.e. what
profiles were added or removed).  In my opinion, if you need to apply more
than one role to a node, you&rsquo;ve introduced a new role (see below).</p>

<h3>Roles CAN use inheritance&hellip;if you like</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people implement roles a couple of different ways, and one of them
is to use inheritance to build a catalog.  For example, you can define a base
<code>roles</code> class that includes something like a base security profile (i.e.
something that EVERY node in your infrastructure should have). Moving down the
line, you COULD namespace according to function like <code>roles::app</code> for your
application server machines. The <code>roles::app</code> class could inherit from the <code>roles</code>
class (which gets the base security profile), and could then include the profiles
necessary to setup an application server. Next, you could subclass down to
<code>roles::app::site_foo</code> for an application server that supports some site in
your organization.  That class inherits from the <code>roles::app</code> class, and then
adds profiles that are specific to that site (maybe they use Jboss instead of
Tomcat, and thus that&rsquo;s where the differentiation occurs). This is great
because you don&rsquo;t have a lot of repeated use of the <code>include</code> function, but
it also makes it hard to definitively look at a specific role to see exactly
what&rsquo;s being declared (i.e. all the profiles). You have to weigh what you
value more: less typing or greater visibility. I will err on the side of
greater visibility (just due to that whole 3am outage thing), but it&rsquo;s up
to you to decide what to optimize for.</p>

<h3>A role similar, yet different, from another role is: a new role</h3>

<p>EVERYBODY says to me &ldquo;Gary, I have this machine that&rsquo;s an AWFUL LOT like
this role over here, but&hellip;it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; My answer to them is: &ldquo;Great,
that&rsquo;s another role.&rdquo;  If the thing that&rsquo;s different is data (i.e. which
database to connect to, or what IP address to route traffic through),
then that difference should be put in HIERA and the classification should
remain the same. If that difference is technology-specific (i.e. this server
uses JBoss instead of Tomcat) then first look and see if you can isolate
how you know this machine is different (maybe it&rsquo;s on a different subnet,
maybe it&rsquo;s at a different location, something like that). If you can figure
that out and write a Fact for it (or use similar conditional logic to determine
this logically), then you can just drop that conditional logic in your role
and let it do the heavy lifting. If, in the end, this bit of data is totally
arbitrary, then you&rsquo;ll need to create another role (perhaps a subclass using
the above namespacing) and assign it to your node.</p>

<p>The hardest thing about this setup is naming your roles. Why? Every site is
different.  It&rsquo;s hard for me to account for differences in your setup because
your workplace is dysfunctional (seriously).</p>

<h2>Review: what does this get you?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through every level of this setup from the top to the bottom and see
what it gets you. Every node is classified to a single role, and, for the most
part, that classification isn&rsquo;t going to change. Now you can take all the extra
work off your classifier tool and put it back into the manifests (that are
subject to version control, so you can <code>git blame</code> to your heart&rsquo;s content and
see who last changed the role/profile). Each role is going to include one or
more profile, which gives us the added idempotent protection of the include
function (of course, if profiles have collisions with classes you&rsquo;ll have to
resolve those. Say one or more profiles tries to include an apache class &ndash;
simply break that component out into a separate profile, extract the parameters
from Hiera, and include that profile at a higher level). Each profile is going
to do Hiera lookups which should give you the ability to provide different data
for different host types (i.e. different data on a per-environment level, or
however you lay out your Hiera hierarchy), and that data will be passed
directly to class that is declared. Finally, each component module will
accept parameters as variables internal to that module, default
parameters/variables to sane values in the <code>::params</code> class, and use those
variables when declaring each resource throughtout its classes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Roles abstract profiles</li>
<li>Profiles abstract component modules</li>
<li>Hiera abstracts configuration data</li>
<li>Component modules abstract resources</li>
<li>Resources abstract the underlying OS implementation</li>
</ul>


<h2>Choose your level of comfortability</h2>

<p>The roles and profiles pattern also buys you something else &ndash; the ability for
less-skilled and more-skilled Puppet users to work with the same codebase.
Let&rsquo;s say you use some GUI classifier (like the Puppet Enterprise Console),
someone who&rsquo;s less skilled at Puppet looks and sees that a node is classified
with a certain role, so they open the role file and see something like this:</p>

<p><code>
include profiles::wordpress
include profiles::tomcat
include profiles::git::repo_server
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty legible, right? Someone who doesn&rsquo;t regularly use Puppet can
probably make a good guess as to what&rsquo;s on the machine. Need more information?
Open one of the profiles and look specifically at the classes that are being
declared. Need to know the data being passed? Jump into Hiera. Need to know
more information? Dig into each component module and see what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>

<p>When you have everything abstracted correctly, you can have developers
providing data (like build versions) to Hiera, junior admins grouping nodes for
classification, more senior folk updating profiles, and your best Puppet people
creating/updating component modules and building plugins like custom
facts/functions/whatever.</p>

<h2>Great! Now go and refactor&hellip;</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used Puppet for more than a month, you&rsquo;re probably familiar with the
&ldquo;Oh shit, I should have done it THAT way&hellip;let me refactor this&rdquo; game. I know,
it sucks, and we at Puppet Labs haven&rsquo;t been shy of incorporating something that
we feel will help people out (but will also require some refactoring). This
pattern, though, has been in use by the Professional Services team at Puppet Labs
for over a year without modification. I&rsquo;ve used this on sites GREAT and small,
and every site with which I&rsquo;ve consulted and implemented this pattern has been
able to both understand its power and derive real value within a week. If you&rsquo;re
contemplating a refactor, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with Roles and Profiles (or
whatever names you decide to use).</p>

    <updated>2014-02-17T14:01:37-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/02/17/puppet-workflow-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working as a professional services engineer for <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com">Puppet Labs</a>,
my life consists almost entirely of either correcting some of the worst code
atrocities you&rsquo;ve seen in your life, or helping people get started with Puppet
so that they don&rsquo;t need to call us again due to: A.) Said code atrocities or
B.) Refactor the work we JUST helped them start.  It wasn&rsquo;t ALWAYS like this &ndash;
I can remember some of my earliest gigs, and I almost feel like I should go
revisit them if only to correct some of the previous &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; that
didn&rsquo;t quite pan out.</p>

<p>This would be exactly why I&rsquo;m wary of &lsquo;Best Practices&rsquo; &ndash; because one person&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Best Practice&rsquo; is another person&rsquo;s &lsquo;What the fuck did you just do?!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Having said that, I&rsquo;m finding myself repeating a story over and over again when
I train/consult, and that&rsquo;s the story of &lsquo;The Usable Puppet Workflow.&rsquo;  Everybody
wants to know &lsquo;The Right Way™&rsquo;, and I feel like we finally have a way that survives
a reasonable test of time. I&rsquo;ve been promoting this workflow for over a year (which
is a HELL of a long time in Startup time), and I&rsquo;ve yet to really see an edge case
it couldn&rsquo;t handle.</p>

<p>(If you&rsquo;re already savvy: yes, this is the Roles and Profiles talk)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be breaking this workflow down into separate blog posts for every component,
and, as always, your comments are welcome&hellip;</p>

<h2>It all starts with the component module</h2>

<p>The first piece of a functional Puppet deployment starts with what we call
&lsquo;component modules&rsquo;.  Component modules are the lowest level in your
deployment, and are modules that configure specific pieces of technology (like
apache, ntp, mysql, and etc&hellip;).  Component modules are well-encapsulated, have
a reasonable API, and focus on doing small, specific things really well (i.e.
the *nix way).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to write thousands of words on building component modules because
I feel like others have done this better than I. As examples, check out
<a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2012/12/13/simple-puppet-module-structure-redux.php">RI&rsquo;s Post on a simple module structure</a>,
<a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/module_guides/bgtm.html">Puppet Labs' very own docs on the subject</a>,
<a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1651-puppetconf2012-puppet-modules-for-fun-and-profit">and even Alessandro&rsquo;s Puppetconf 2012 session.</a> Instead, I&rsquo;d like to
provide some pointers on what I feel makes a good component module, and some
&lsquo;gotchas&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>

<h3>Parameters are your API</h3>

<p>In the current world of Puppet, you MUST define the parameters your module will
accept in the Puppet DSL. Also, every parameter MUST ultimately have a value
when Puppet compiles the catalog (whether by explicitly passing this parameter
value when declaring the class, or by assuming a default value). Yes, it&rsquo;s
funny that, when writing a Puppet class, if you typo a VARIABLE Puppet will
not alert you to this (in a NON <code>use strict</code>-ian sort of approach) and will
happily accept a variable in an undefined state, but the second you don&rsquo;t pass
a value to your class parameter you&rsquo;re in for a rude compilation error.
This is the way of Puppet classes at the time of this writing, so you&rsquo;re going
to see Puppet classes with LINES of defined parameters. I expect this to change
in the future (please let this change in the near future), but for now, it&rsquo;s
a necessary evil.</p>

<p>The parameters you expose to your top-level class (i.e. given class names like
<code>apache</code> and <code>apache::install</code>, I&rsquo;m talking specifically about <code>apache</code>) should
be treated as an API to your module. IDEALLY, they&rsquo;re the ONLY THING that
a user needs to modify when using your module. Also, whenever possible, it
should be the case that a user need ONLY interact with the top-level class when
using your module (of course, defined resource types like <code>apache::vhost</code> are
used on an ad-hoc basis, and thus are the exception here).</p>

<h3>Inherit the <code>::params</code> class</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re starting to make enemies at this point. It&rsquo;s been a convention for modules
to use a <code>::params</code> class to assign values to all variables that are going to
be used for all classes inside the module. The idea is that the <code>::params</code> class
is the one-stop-shop to see where a variable is set. Also, to get access to a
variable that&rsquo;s set in a Puppet class, you have to declare the class (i.e. use
the <code>include()</code> function or inherit from that class). When you declare a class
that has both variables AND resources, those resources get put into the catalog,
which means that Puppet ENFORCES THE STATE of those resources. What if you only
needed a variable&rsquo;s value and didn&rsquo;t want to enforce the rest of the resources
in that class? There&rsquo;s no good way in Puppet to do that. Finally, when you inherit
from a class in Puppet that has assigned variable values, you ALSO get access
to those variables in the parameter definition section of your class (i.e. the
following section of the class:</p>

<pre><code>class apache (
  $port = $apache::params::port,
  $user = $apache::params::user,
) inherits apache::params {
</code></pre>

<p>See how I set the default value of <code>$apache::port</code> to <code>$apache::params::port</code>?
I could only access the value of the variable <code>$apache::params::port</code> in that
section by inheriting from the <code>apache::params</code> class.  I couldn&rsquo;t insert
<code>include apache::params</code> below that section and be allowed access to the variable
up in the parameter defaults section (due to the way that Puppet parses classes).</p>

<p><strong>FOR THIS REASON, THIS IS THE </strong><em>ONLY</em><strong> RECOMMENDED USAGE OF INHERITANCE IN
PUPPET!</strong></p>

<p>We do NOT recommend using inheritance anywhere else in Puppet and for any other
reason because there are better ways to achieve what you want to do INSTEAD of
using inheritance.  Inheritance is a holdover from a scarier, more lawless time.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Data in Modules</strong> &ndash; There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Data in Modules&rsquo; pattern out there that
attempts to eliminate the <code>::params</code> class.  <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/12/08/when-to-hiera/">I wrote about it in a previous post</a>,
and I recommend you read that post for more info (it&rsquo;s near the bottom).</p>

<h3>Do <strong>NOT</strong> do Hiera lookups in your component modules!</h3>

<p>This is something that&rsquo;s really only RECENTLY been pushed. When Hiera was
released, we quickly recognized that it would be the answer to quite a few
problems in Puppet. In the rush to adopt Hiera, many people started adding
Hiera calls to their modules, and suddenly you had &lsquo;Hiera-compatible&rsquo; modules
out there. This caused all kinds of compatibility problems, and it was largely
because there wasn&rsquo;t a better module structure and workflow by which to integrate
Hiera. The pattern that I&rsquo;ll be pushing DOES INDEED use Hiera, <strong>BUT</strong> it
confines all Hiera calls to a higher-level wrapper class we call a &lsquo;profile&rsquo;.
The reasons for NOT using Hiera in your module are:</p>

<ul>
<li>By doing Hiera calls at a higher level, you have a greater visibility on
exactly what parameters were set by Hiera and which were set explicitly or by
default values.</li>
<li>By doing Hiera calls elsewhere, your module is backwards-compatible for
those folks who are NOT using Hiera</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember &ndash; your module should just accept a value and use it somewhere. Don&rsquo;t
get <strong>TOO</strong> smart with your component module &ndash; leave the logic for other
places.</p>

<h3>Keep your component modules generic</h3>

<p>We always get asked &ldquo;How do I know if I&rsquo;m writing a good module?&rdquo; We USED to
say &ldquo;Well, does it work?&rdquo; (and trust me, that was a BIG hurdle). Now, with
data separation models out there like Hiera, I have a couple of other questions
that I ask (you know, BEYOND asking if it compiles and actually installs the
thing it&rsquo;s supposed to install). The best way I&rsquo;ve found to determine if your
module is &lsquo;generic enough&rsquo; is if I asked you TODAY to give me your module,
would you give it to me, or would you be worried that there was some
company-specific data locked in there? If you have company-specific data in
your module, then you need to refactor the module, store the data in Hiera, and
make your module more generic/reusable. Also, does your module focus on installing
one piece of technology, or are you declaring packages for shared libraries
or other components (like gcc, apache, or other common components)? You&rsquo;re
not going to win any prizes for having the biggest, most monolithic module
out there. Rather, if your module is that large and that complex, you&rsquo;re
going to have a hell of a time debugging it. Err on the side of making your
modules smaller and more task-specific. So what if you end up needing to
declare 4 classes where you previously declared 1? In the roles and profiles
pattern we will show you in the next blog post, you can abstract that away
ANYHOW.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t play the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; game</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had more than a couple of gigs where the customer says something along the
lines of &ldquo;What if we need to introduce FreeBSD/Solaris/etc&hellip; nodes into our
organization, shouldn&rsquo;t I account for them now?&rdquo; This leads more than a few
people down a path of entirely too-complex modules that become bulky and
unwieldy. Yes, your modules should be formatted so that you can simply add
another case in your <code>::params</code> class for another OS&rsquo;s parameters, and yes,
your module should be formatted so that your <code>::install</code> or <code>::config</code>
class can handle another OS, but if you currently only manage Redhat, and
you&rsquo;ve only EVER managed Redhat, then don&rsquo;t start adding Debian parameters
RIGHT NOW just because you&rsquo;re afraid you might inherit Ubuntu machines. The
goal of Puppet is to automate the tasks that eat up the MAJORITY of your time
so you can focus on the edge cases that really demand your time. If you can
eventually automate those edge cases, then AWESOME! Until then, don&rsquo;t spend
the majority of your time trying to automate the edge cases only to drown
under the weight of deadlines from simple work that you COULD have already
automated (but didn&rsquo;t, because you were so worried about the exceptions)!</p>

<h3>Store your modules in version control</h3>

<p>This should go without saying, but your modules should be stored in version
control (a la git, svn, hg, whatever). We tend to prefer git due to its lightweight
branching and merging (most of our tooling and solutions will use git because
we&rsquo;re big git users), but you&rsquo;re free to use whatever you want. The bigger
question is HOW to store your modules in version control. There are usually
two schools of thought:</p>

<ul>
<li>One repository per module</li>
<li>All modules in a single repository</li>
</ul>


<p>Each model has its pros and cons, but we tend to recommend one module per
repository for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individual repos mean individual module development histories</li>
<li>Most VCS solutions don&rsquo;t have per-folder ACLs for a single repositories;
having multiple repos allows per-module security settings.</li>
<li>With the one-repository-per-module solution, modules you pull down from the
Forge (or Github) must be committed to your repo. Having multiple
repositories for each module allow you to keep everything separate</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This becomes important in the third blog post in the series when we
talk about moving changes to each Puppet Environment, but it&rsquo;s important to
introduce it NOW as a &lsquo;best practice&rsquo;. If you use our recommended module/environment
solution, then one-module-per-repo is the best practice. If you DON&rsquo;T use our
solution, then the single repository per for all modules will STILL work,
but you&rsquo;ll have to manage the above issues. Also note that even if you currently
have every module in a single repository, you can STILL use our solution in
part 3 of the series (you&rsquo;ll just need to perform a couple of steps to conform).</p>

<h2>Best practices are shit</h2>

<p>In general, &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; are only recommended if they fit into your organizational
workflow. The best and worst part of Puppet is that it&rsquo;s infinitely customizable,
so &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; will invariably be left wanting for a certain subset of the
community. As always, take what I say under consideration; it&rsquo;s quite possible
that I could be entirely full of shit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clarke&rsquo;s third law states: &ldquo;Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic.&rdquo; In the case of Ruby and Puppet provider
interaction, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe it. If you want proof, take a look at some
of the native Puppet types &ndash; no amount of &lsquo;Expecto Patronum&rsquo; will free you from
the Ruby metaprogramming dementors that hover around
<code>lib/puppet/provider/exec</code>-land.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/11/25/fun-with-providers/">first post tackling Puppet types and providers</a>, I introduced
the concept of Puppet types and the utility they provide. <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/11/26/fun-with-providers-part-2/">In the second post,</a>
I brought you to the great plain of Puppet providers and introduced the core
methods necessary for creating a very basic Puppet provider with a single property
(HINT: if you&rsquo;ve not read either of those posts, or you&rsquo;ve never dealt with basic
types and providers, you might want to stop here and read up a bit on the topics).
The problems with a provider like the one created in that post were:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>puppet resource</code> support wasn&rsquo;t implemented, so you couldn&rsquo;t query for existing instances of the type on the system (and their corresponding values)</li>
<li>The getter method would be called for EVERY instance of the type on the system, which would mean shelling-out multiple times during a run</li>
<li>Ditto for the setter method (if changes to multiple instances of the type were necessary)</li>
<li>That type was VERY basic (i.e. ensurable with a single property)</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately, when most of us have the need of a Puppet type and provider, we
usually require multiple properties and reasonably complex system interaction. When
it comes to creating both a getter and a setter method for every property (including
the potential performance hit that could come from shelling-out many times during
a Puppet run), ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that. And finally, <code>puppet resource</code> is a
REALLY handy tool for querying the current state of your resources on a system.
These problems all have solutions, but up until recently there was just one more
problem:</p>

<p><strong>Good luck finding documentation for those solutions.</strong></p>

<p>NOTE: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Puppet-Types-Providers-Dan-Bode/dp/1449339328/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387136838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=types+and+providers+puppet+book">Puppet Types and Providers book written by Nan and Dan</a>
is a great resource that provides a bit of a deeper dive than I&rsquo;ll be doing in this
post &ndash; DO check it out if you want to know more</p>

<h2>Something, something, <code>puppet resource</code></h2>

<p>The <code>puppet resource</code> command (or <code>ralsh</code>, as it used to be known), is a very
handy command for querying a system and returning the current state of resources
for a specific Puppet type.  Try it out if you never have (note that the following
is being run on CentOS 6.4):</p>

<pre><code>[root@linux ~]# puppet resource user
user { 'abrt':
  ensure           =&gt; 'present',
  gid              =&gt; '173',
  home             =&gt; '/etc/abrt',
  password         =&gt; '!!',
  password_max_age =&gt; '-1',
  password_min_age =&gt; '-1',
  shell            =&gt; '/sbin/nologin',
  uid              =&gt; '173',
}
user { 'adm':
  ensure           =&gt; 'present',
  comment          =&gt; 'adm',
  gid              =&gt; '4',
  groups           =&gt; ['sys', 'adm'],
  home             =&gt; '/var/adm',
  password         =&gt; '*',
  password_max_age =&gt; '99999',
  password_min_age =&gt; '0',
  shell            =&gt; '/sbin/nologin',
  uid              =&gt; '3',
}
&lt; ... and more users below ... &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>puppet resource</code> command returns a list of all users on the system
and their current property values (note you can only see the password
hash if you&rsquo;re running Puppet with sufficient privileges). You can even
query <code>puppet resource</code> for the values of a specific resource:</p>

<pre><code>[root@gary ~]# puppet resource user glarizza
user { 'glarizza':
  ensure           =&gt; 'present',
  gid              =&gt; '502',
  home             =&gt; '/home/glarizza',
  password         =&gt; '$1$hsUuCygh$kgLKG5epuRaXHMX5KmxrL1',
  password_max_age =&gt; '99999',
  password_min_age =&gt; '0',
  shell            =&gt; '/bin/bash',
  uid              =&gt; '502',
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>puppet resource</code> seems magical, and you might think that if you create a
custom type and sync it to your machine then <code>puppet resource</code> will automatically
work for you.</p>

<p><strong>And you would be wrong.</strong></p>

<p><code>puppet resource</code> will only work if you&rsquo;ve implemented a special method in your
provider called <code>self.instances</code>.</p>

<h2><code>self.instances</code></h2>

<p>The <code>self.instances</code> method is pretty sparsely documented, so let&rsquo;s go straight
to the source&hellip;code, that is:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby lib/puppet/provider.rb %}
  # Returns a list of system resources (entities) this provider may/can manage.
  # This is a query mechanism that lists entities that the provider may manage on a given system. It is
  # is directly used in query services, but is also the foundation for other services; prefetching, and
  # purging.
  #
  # As an example, a package provider lists all installed packages. (In contrast, the File provider does
  # not list all files on the file-system as that would make execution incredibly slow). An implementation
  # of this method should be made if it is possible to quickly (with a single system call) provide all
  # instances.
  #
  # An implementation of this method should only cache the values of properties
  # if they are discovered as part of the process for finding existing resources.
  # Resource properties that require additional commands (than those used to determine existence/identity)
  # should be implemented in their respective getter method. (This is important from a performance perspective;
  # it may be expensive to compute, as well as wasteful as all discovered resources may perhaps not be managed).
  #
  # An implementation may return an empty list (naturally with the effect that it is not possible to query
  # for manageable entities).
  #
  # By implementing this method, it is possible to use the `resources´ resource type to specify purging
  # of all non managed entities.
  #
  # @note The returned instances are instance of some subclass of Provider, not resources.
  # @return [Array&lt;Puppet::Provider>] a list of providers referencing the system entities
  # @abstract this method must be implemented by a subclass and this super method should never be called as it raises an exception.
  # @raise [Puppet::DevError] Error indicating that the method should have been implemented by subclass.
  # @see prefetch
  def self.instances</p>

<pre><code>raise Puppet::DevError, "Provider #{self.name} has not defined the 'instances' class method"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find that method around lines 348 &ndash; 377 of the <code>lib/puppet/provider.rb</code>
file in Puppet&rsquo;s source code (as of this writing, which is a Friday&hellip;
on a flight from DC to Seattle). To summarize, implementing <code>self.instances</code>
in your provider means that you need to return an array of provider instances
that have been discovered on the current system and all the current property
values (we call these values the &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for the properties, since each
value IS the current value of the property on the system). It&rsquo;s recommended to only
implement <code>self.instances</code> if you can gather all resource property values in a reasonably
&lsquo;cheap&rsquo; manner (i.e. a single system call, read from a single file, or some
similar low-IO means). Implementing <code>self.instances</code> not only gives you the
ability to run <code>puppet resource</code> (which also affords you a quick-and-dirty
way of testing your provider without creating unit tests by simply running
<code>puppet resource</code> in debug mode and checking the output), but it also allows
the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#resources">&lsquo;resources&rsquo; resource</a> to work its magic (If you&rsquo;ve
never heard of the &lsquo;resources&rsquo; resource, <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#resources">check this link</a>
for more information on this terribly/awesomely named resource type).</p>

<h3>An important note about scope and <code>self.instances</code></h3>

<p>The <code>self.instances</code> method is a method of the PROVIDER, which is why it is
prefixed with <code>self.</code>  Even though it may be located in the provider file
itself, and even though it sits among other methods like <code>create</code>, <code>exists?</code>,
and <code>destroy</code> (which are methods of the INSTANCE of the provider), it does
NOT have the ability to directly access or call those methods. It DOES have
the ability to access other methods of the provider directly (i.e. other
methods prefixed with <code>self.</code>).  This means that if you were to define a
method like:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def self.proxy_type
  &lsquo;web&rsquo;
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>You could access that directly from <code>self.instances</code> by simply calling it:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
type_of_proxy = proxy_type()
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you had a method of the INSTANCE of the provider, like so:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def system_type
  &lsquo;OS X&rsquo;
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>You COULD NOT access this method from <code>self.instances</code> directly (there are
always hacky ways around EVERYTHING in Ruby, sure, but there is no easy/straightforward
way to access this method).</p>

<p><strong>And here&rsquo;s where it gets confusing&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Methods of the INSTANCE of the provider CAN access provider methods directly.
Given our previous example, what if the <code>system_type</code> method wanted to access
<code>self.proxy_type</code> for some reason?  It could be done like so:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def system_type
  type_of_proxy = self.class.proxy_type()
  &lsquo;OS X&rsquo;
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>A method of the instance of the provider can access provider methods by simply
calling the <code>class</code> method on itself (which returns the provider object). This
is a one-way street for method creation that needs to be heeded when designing
your provider.</p>

<h2>Building a provider that uses <code>self.instances</code> (or: more Mac problems)</h2>

<p>In the previous two posts on types/providers, I created a type and provider
for managing bypass domains for network proxies on OS X. For this post, let&rsquo;s
create a provider for actually MANAGING the proxy settings for a given
network interface.  Here&rsquo;s a quick type for managing a web proxy on a network
interface on OS X:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby puppet-mac_proxy/lib/puppet/type/mac_web_proxy.rb %}
Puppet::Type.newtype(:mac_web_proxy) do
  desc &ldquo;Puppet type that models a network interface on OS X&rdquo;</p>

<p>  ensurable</p>

<p>  newparam(:name, :namevar => true) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Interface name - currently must be 'friendly' name (e.g. Ethernet)"
munge do |value|
  value.downcase
end
def insync?(is)
  is.downcase == should.downcase
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  newproperty(:proxy_server) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Proxy Server setting for the interface"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  newparam(:authenticated_username) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Username for proxy authentication"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  newparam(:authenticated_password) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Password for proxy authentication"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  newproperty(:proxy_authenticated) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Proxy Server setting for the interface"
newvalues(:true, :false)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  newproperty(:proxy_port) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Proxy Server setting for the interface"
newvalues(/^\d+$/)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>This type has three properties, is ensurable, and a namevar called &lsquo;name&rsquo;. As
for the provider, let&rsquo;s start with <code>self.instances</code> and get the web proxy
values for all interfaces.  To do that we&rsquo;re going to need to know how to get
a list of all network interfaces, and also how to get the current proxy state
for every interface. Fortunately, both of those tasks are accomplished with the
<code>networksetup</code> binary:</p>

<pre><code>▷ networksetup -listallnetworkservices
An asterisk (*) denotes that a network service is disabled.
Bluetooth DUN
Display Ethernet
Ethernet
FireWire
Wi-Fi
iPhone USB
Bluetooth PAN

▷ networksetup -getwebproxy Ethernet
Enabled: No
Server: proxy.corp.net
Port: 1234
Authenticated Proxy Enabled: 0
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, so one binary will do both tasks and they&rsquo;re REASONABLY low-cost to run.</p>

<h3>Helper methods</h3>

<p>To keep things separated and easier to test, let&rsquo;s create separate helper methods
for each task. Since these methods are going to be called by <code>self.instances</code>,
they will be provider methods.</p>

<p>The first method will simply return an array of network interfaces:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def self.get_list_of_interfaces
  interfaces = networksetup(&lsquo;-listallnetworkservices&rsquo;).split(&ldquo;\n&rdquo;)
  interfaces.shift
  interfaces.sort
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Remember from above that the <code>networksetup -listallnetworkservices</code> command
returns an info line before each interface, so this code strips that line
off and returns a sorted list of interfaces based on a one-line-per-interface
assumption.</p>

<p>The next method we need will accept a network interface name as an argument,
will run the <code>networksetup -getwebproxy (interface)</code> command, and will use
its output to return all the current property values (including the ensure
value) for every instance of the type on the system (i.e. every interface&rsquo;s
proxy settings and whether the proxy is enabled, which means the resource
is ensured as &lsquo;present&rsquo;, or disabled, which means the resource is ensured
as &lsquo;absent&rsquo;.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def self.get_proxy_properties(int)
  interface_properties = {}</p>

<p>  begin</p>

<pre><code>output = networksetup(['-getwebproxy', int])
</code></pre>

<p>  rescue Puppet::ExecutionFailure => e</p>

<pre><code>raise Puppet::Error, "#mac_web_proxy tried to run `networksetup -getwebproxy #{int}` and the command returned non-zero. Failing here..."
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  output_array = output.split(&ldquo;\n&rdquo;)
  output_array.each do |line|</p>

<pre><code>line_values = line.split(':')
line_values.last.strip!
case line_values.first
when 'Enabled'
  interface_properties[:ensure] = line_values.last == 'No' ? :absent : :present
when 'Server'
  interface_properties[:proxy_server] = line_values.last.empty? ? nil : line_values.last
when 'Port'
  interface_properties[:proxy_port] = line_values.last == '0' ? nil : line_values.last
when 'Authenticated Proxy Enabled'
  interface_properties[:proxy_authenticated] = line_values.last == '0' ? nil : line_values.last
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  interface_properties[:provider] = :ruby
  interface_properties[:name]     = int.downcase
  interface_properties
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>A couple of notes on the method itself &ndash; first, the <code>networksetup</code> command must
exit zero on success or non-zero on failure (which it does). If ever the <code>networksetup</code>
command were to return non-zero, we&rsquo;re raising our own Puppet::Error, documenting what
happened, and bailing out.</p>

<p>This method is going to return a hash of properties and values that is going
to be used by <code>self.instances</code> &ndash; so the case statement needs to account for that.
HOWEVER you populate that hash is up to you (in my case, I&rsquo;m checking for specific
output that <code>networksetup</code> returns), but make sure that the hash has a value for
the <code>:ensure</code> key at the VERY least.</p>

<h3>Assembling <code>self.instances</code></h3>

<p>Once the helper provider methods have been defined, <code>self.instances</code> becomes
reasonably simple:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def self.instances
  get_list_of_interfaces.collect do |int|</p>

<pre><code>proxy_properties = get_proxy_properties(int)
new(proxy_properties)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Remember that <code>self.instances</code> must return an array of provider instances,
and each one of these instances must include the <code>namevar</code> and ensure value
at the very least. Since <code>self.get_proxy_properties</code> returns a hash containing
all the property &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for a resource, declaring a new provider instance
is as easy as calling the <code>new()</code> method on the return value of
<code>self.get_proxy_properties</code> for every network interface. In the end, the
return value of the <code>collect</code> method on <code>get_list_of_interfaces</code> will be an
array of provider instances.</p>

<h2>Existance, <code>@property_hash</code>, and more magical methods</h2>

<p>Even though we have assembled a functional <code>self.instances</code> method, we don&rsquo;t have
complete implementation that will work with <code>puppet resource</code>.  The problem is
that Puppet can&rsquo;t yet determine the existance of a resource (even though the
resource&rsquo;s <code>ensure</code> value has been set by <code>self.instances</code>). If you were to
execute the code with <code>puppet resource mac_web_proxy</code>, you would get the error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Could not run: No ability to determine if mac_web_proxy exists
</code></pre>

<p>To satisfy Puppet, we need to implement an <code>exists?()</code> method for the instance
of the provider. Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t need to re-implement any existing logic
and can instead use <code>@property_hash</code></p>

<h3>A <code>@property_hash</code> is born&hellip;</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve omitted one last thing that is borne out of <code>self.instances</code>, and that&rsquo;s
the <code>@property_hash</code> instance variable. <code>@property_hash</code> is populated by
<code>self.instances</code> as an instance variable that&rsquo;s available to methods of the
INSTANCE of the provider (i.e. methods that ARE NOT prefixed with <code>self.</code>)
containing all the &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for a resource. Do you need to get the &lsquo;is&rsquo;
value for a property?  Just use <code>@property_hash[:property_name]</code>. Since the
<code>exists?</code> method is a method of the instance of the provider, and it&rsquo;s
essentially the same thing as the <code>ensure</code> value for a resource, let&rsquo;s implement
<code>exists?</code> by doing a check on the ensure value from the <code>@property_hash</code>
variable:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def exists?
  @property_hash[:ensure] == :present
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Perfect, now <code>exists?</code> will return true or false accordingly and Puppet will be
satisfied.</p>

<h3>Getter methods &ndash; the slow way</h3>

<p>Puppet may be happy that you have an <code>exists?</code> method, but <code>puppet resource</code>
won&rsquo;t successfully run until you have a method that returns an &lsquo;is&rsquo; value for
every property of the type (i.e. the <code>proxy_server</code>, <code>proxy_authenticated</code>,
and <code>proxy_port</code> attributes for the mac_web_proxy type). These &lsquo;is value methods&rsquo; are
called &lsquo;getter&rsquo; methods: they&rsquo;re methods of the instance of the provider, and
are named exactly the same as the properties they represent.</p>

<p>You SHOULD be thinking: &ldquo;Hey, we already have <code>@property_hash</code>, why can&rsquo;t we
just use it again? We can, and you COULD implement all the getter methods
like so:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def proxy_server
  @property_hash[:proxy_server]
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>If you did that, you would be TECHNICALLY correct, but it would seem to be a
waste of lines in a provider (especially if you have many properties).</p>

<h3>Getter methods &ndash; the quicker &lsquo;method&rsquo;</h3>

<p>Because uncle Luke hated excess lines of code, he made available a method called
<code>mk_resource_methods</code> which works very similarly to Ruby&rsquo;s <code>attr_accessor</code>
method. Adding <code>mk_resource_methods</code> to your provider will AUTOMATICALLY
create getter methods that pull values out of <code>@property_hash</code> in the similar
way that I just demonstrated (it will also create SETTER methods too, but we&rsquo;ll
look at those later). Long story short &ndash; don&rsquo;t make getter/setter methods if
you&rsquo;re using self.instances &ndash; just implement <code>mk_resource_methods</code>.</p>

<h2>JUST enough for <code>puppet resource</code></h2>

<p>Putting everything that we&rsquo;ve learned up until now, we should have a provider
that looks like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby lib/puppet/provider/mac_web_proxy/ruby.rb %}
Puppet::Type.type(:mac_web_proxy).provide(:ruby) do
  commands :networksetup => &lsquo;networksetup&rsquo;</p>

<p>  mk_resource_methods</p>

<p>  def self.get_list_of_interfaces</p>

<pre><code>interfaces = networksetup('-listallnetworkservices').split("\n")
interfaces.shift
interfaces.sort
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.get_proxy_properties(int)</p>

<pre><code>interface_properties = {}

begin
  output = networksetup(['-getwebproxy', int])
rescue Puppet::ExecutionFailure =&gt; e
  Puppet.debug "#get_proxy_properties had an error -&gt; #{e.inspect}"
  return {}
end

output_array = output.split("\n")
output_array.each do |line|
  line_values = line.split(':')
  line_values.last.strip!
  case line_values.first
  when 'Enabled'
    interface_properties[:ensure] = line_values.last == 'No' ? :absent : :present
  when 'Server'
    interface_properties[:proxy_server] = line_values.last.empty? ? nil : line_values.last
  when 'Port'
    interface_properties[:proxy_port] = line_values.last == '0' ? nil : line_values.last
  when 'Authenticated Proxy Enabled'
    interface_properties[:proxy_authenticated] = line_values.last == '0' ? nil : line_values.last
  end
end

interface_properties[:provider] = :ruby
interface_properties[:name]     = int.downcase
Puppet.debug "Interface properties: #{interface_properties.inspect}"
interface_properties
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.instances</p>

<pre><code>get_list_of_interfaces.collect do |int|
  proxy_properties = get_proxy_properties(int)
  new(proxy_properties)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def exists?</p>

<pre><code>@property_hash[:ensure] == :present
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a tree of the module I&rsquo;ve assembled on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>└(~/src/puppet-mac_web_proxy)▷ tree .

       └── type
           └── mac_web_proxy.rb
</code></pre>

<p>To test out <code>puppet resource</code>, we need to make Puppet aware of our new custom
module. To do that, let&rsquo;s set the <code>$RUBYLIB</code> environmental variable. <code>$RUBYLIB</code>
is queried by Puppet and is added to its load path when looking for additional
Puppet plugins.  You will need to set <code>$RUBYLIB</code> to the path of the <code>lib</code> directory
in the custom module that you&rsquo;ve assembled.  Because my custom module is located
in <code>~/src/puppet-mac_web_proxy</code>, I&rsquo;m going to set <code>$RUBYLIB</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>export RUBYLIB=~/src/puppet-mac_web_proxy/lib
</code></pre>

<p>You can execute that command from the command line, or set it in your
<code>~/.{bash,zsh}rc</code> and <code>source</code> that file.</p>

<p>Finally, with all the files in place and <code>$RUBYLIB</code> set, it&rsquo;s time to officially
run <code>puppet resource</code> (I&rsquo;m going to do it in <code>--debug</code> mode to see the debug output
that I&rsquo;ve written into the code):</p>

<p>Note that you will only see &lsquo;is&rsquo; values if you have a proxy set on any of your
network interfaces (obviously, if you&rsquo;ve not setup a proxy, then it will show
as &lsquo;absent&rsquo; on every interface. You can setup a proxy by opening System
Preferences, clicking on the Network icon, choosing an interface from the list
on the left, clicking the Advanced button in the lower right corner of the
window, clicking the &lsquo;Proxies" tab at the top of the window, clicking the
checkbox next to the &ldquo;Web Proxy (HTTP)&rdquo; choice, and entering a proxy URL and
port. NOW do you get why we automate this bullshit?).  Also, your list of
network interfaces may not match mine if you have more or less interfaces than
I do.</p>

<p>TADA! <code>puppet resource</code> WORKS! ISN&rsquo;T THAT AWESOME?! WHY AM I TYPING IN CAPS?!</p>

<h2>Prefetching, flushing, caching, and other hard shit</h2>

<p>Okay, so up until now we&rsquo;ve implemented one half of the equation &ndash; we can query
&lsquo;is&rsquo; values and <code>puppet resource</code> works. What about using this &lsquo;more efficient&rsquo;
method of getting values for a type on the OTHER end of the spectrum? What if
instead of calling setter methods one-by-one to set values for all resources
of a type in a catalog we had a way to do it all at once? Well, such a way
exists, and it&rsquo;s called the <code>flush</code> method&hellip;but we&rsquo;re getting slightly ahead
of ourselves. Before we get to flushing, we need to point out that <code>self.instances</code>
is ONLY used by <code>puppet resource</code> &ndash; THAT&rsquo;S IT (and it&rsquo;s only used by <code>self.instances</code>
when you GET values from the system, not when you SET values on the system&hellip;and if
you never knew that <code>puppet resource</code> could actually SET values on the system, well,
I guess you got another surprise today). If we want <code>puppet agent</code> or
<code>puppet apply</code> to use the behavior that <code>self.instances</code> implements, we need
to create another method: <code>self.prefetch</code></p>

<h3><code>self.prefetch</code></h3>

<p>If you thought <code>self.instances</code> didn&rsquo;t have much documentation, wait until
you see <code>self.prefetch</code>.  After wading the waters of <code>self.prefetch</code>, I&rsquo;m
PRETTY SURE its implementation might have come to uncle Luke after a long
night in Reed&rsquo;s chem lab where he might have accidently synthesized mescaline.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the codebase:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby lib/puppet/provider.rb %}</p>

<h1>@comment Document prefetch here as it does not exist anywhere else (called from transaction if implemented)</h1>

<h1>@!method self.prefetch(resource_hash)</h1>

<h1>@abstract A subclass may implement this &ndash; it is not implemented in the Provider class</h1>

<h1>This method may be implemented by a provider in order to pre-fetch resource properties.</h1>

<h1>If implemented it should set the provider instance of the managed resources to a provider with the</h1>

<h1>fetched state (i.e. what is returned from the {instances} method).</h1>

<h1>@param resources_hash [Hash&lt;{String => Puppet::Resource}>] map from name to resource of resources to prefetch</h1>

<h1>@return [void]</h1>

<h1>@api public</h1>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, documentation for <code>self.prefetch</code> in the Puppet codebase is
9 lines of comments in <code>lib/puppet/provider.rb</code>, which is awesome. So when
is <code>self.prefetch</code> used to provide information to Puppet and when is <code>self.instances</code> used?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that <code>self.instances</code> is really only handy for <code>puppet
resource</code> &ndash; that&rsquo;s definitely not the case.  In fact, frequently you will find
that <code>self.instances</code> is used by <code>self.prefetch</code> to do some of the heavy
lifting.  Even though <code>self.prefetch</code> works VERY SIMILARLY to the way that
<code>self.instances</code> works for <code>puppet resource</code> (and by that I mean that it&rsquo;s
going to gather a list of instances of a type on the system, and it&rsquo;s also
going to populate <code>@property_hash</code> for <code>puppet apply</code>, <code>puppet agent</code>, and when
when <code>puppet resource</code> is setting values), it&rsquo;s not an exact one-for-one match
with <code>self.instances</code>.  The <code>self.prefetch</code> method for a type is called once
per run when Puppet encounters a resource of that type in the catalog. The
argument to <code>self.prefetch</code> is a hash of all managed resources of that type
that are encountered in a compiled catalog for that node (the hash&rsquo;s key will
be the <code>namevar</code> of the resource, and the value will be an instance of
<code>Puppet::Type</code> &ndash; in this case, <code>Puppet::Type::Mac_web_proxy</code>).  Your task is to
implement a <code>self.prefetch</code> method that gets an array of instances of the
provider that are discovered on the system, iterates through the hash passed to
<code>self.prefetch</code> (containing all the resources of the type that were discovered
in the catalog), and passes the correct instance of the provider that was
discovered on the system to the <code>provider=</code> method of the correct instance of
the type that was discovered in the catalog.</p>

<p><strong>What the actual fuck?!</strong></p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s break that apart to try and discover exactly what&rsquo;s going on here.
Assume that I&rsquo;ve setup a proxy for the &lsquo;FireWire&rsquo; interface on my laptop, and
I want to try and manage that resource with <code>puppet apply</code> (i.e. something that
uses <code>self.prefetch</code>). The resource in the manifest used to manage the proxy
will look something like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet %}
mac_web_proxy { &lsquo;firewire&rsquo;:
  ensure       => &lsquo;present&rsquo;,
  proxy_port   => &lsquo;8080&rsquo;,
  proxy_server => &lsquo;proxy.server.org&rsquo;,
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>When <code>self.prefetch</code> is called by Puppet, it&rsquo;s going to be passed a hash looking
something like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
{ &ldquo;firewire&rdquo; => Mac_web_proxy[firewire] }
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Because only one resource is encountered in the catalog, only one key/value
pair shows up in the hash that&rsquo;s passed as the argument to <code>self.prefetch</code>.</p>

<p>The job of <code>self.prefetch</code> is to find the current state of <code>Mac_web_proxy['firewire']</code>
on the system, create a new instance of the <code>mac_web_proxy</code> provider that contains
the &lsquo;is&rsquo; values for the <code>Mac_web_proxy['firewire']</code> resource, and assign this provider instance as the value
of the <code>provider=</code> method to the instance of the mac_web_proxy TYPE that is the
VALUE of the &lsquo;firewire&rsquo; key of the hash that&rsquo;s passed to <code>self.prefetch</code>.</p>

<p><strong>No, really, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. I&rsquo;m not even sure what&rsquo;s real anymore</strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll remember that <code>self.instances</code> gives us an array of resources that were
discovered on the system, so we have THAT part of the implementation written. We also have the
hash of resources that were encountered in the catalog &ndash; so we have THAT
part done too. Our only job is to connect the dots (la la la la), programmatically
speaking.  This should just about do it:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def self.prefetch(resources)
  instances.each do |prov|</p>

<pre><code>if resource = resources[prov.name]
  resource.provider = prov
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>I want to make a confession right now &ndash; I&rsquo;ve only ever copied and pasted this
code into every provider I&rsquo;ve ever written that needed <code>self.prefetch</code> implemented.
It wasn&rsquo;t until someone actually asked me what it DID that I had to walk the path
of figuring out EXACTLY what it did. Based on the last couple of paragraphs &ndash; can
you blame me?</p>

<p>This code iterates through the array of resources returned by <code>self.instances</code>,
tries to assign a variable <code>resource</code> based on referencing a key in the
<code>resources</code> hash using the name of the resource (remember, <code>resources</code> is
a hash containing all resources in the catalog), and, if this assignment works
(i.e. it isn&rsquo;t <code>nil</code>, which is what happens when you reference a key in a Ruby
hash that doesn&rsquo;t exist), then we&rsquo;re calling the <code>provider=</code> method on the
instance of the type that was referenced in the <code>resources</code> hash, and passing
it the resource that was discovered on the system by <code>self.instances</code>.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Why <strong>DID</strong> we do all of that?  We did it all for the <code>@provider_hash</code>. Doing
this will populate <code>@provider_hash</code> in all methods of the instance of the
provider (i.e. <code>exists?</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>destroy</code>, etc..) just like <code>self.instances</code>
did for <code>puppet resource</code>.</p>

<h2>Flush it; Ship it</h2>

<p>As I alluded to above, the opposite side of the coin to prefetching (which
is a way to query the state for all resources at once) is flushing (or
specifically the <code>flush</code> method). The <code>flush</code> method is called once per
resource whenever the &lsquo;is&rsquo; and &lsquo;should&rsquo; values for a property differ (and
synchronization needs to occur). The <code>flush</code> method <strong>does not take the place
of property setter methods</strong>, but, rather, is used in conjunction with them
to determine how to synchronize resource property values. In this vein, it&rsquo;s
a single trigger that can be used to set all property values for an individual
resource simultaneously.</p>

<p>There are a couple of strategies for implementing <code>flush</code>, but one of the more
popular ones in use is to create an instance variable that will hold values to
be synchronized, and then determine inside <code>flush</code> how best to make
as-few-as-possible calls to the system to synchronize all the property values
for an individual resource.</p>

<p>Our resource type is unique because the <code>networksetup</code> binary that we&rsquo;ll be
using to synchronize values allows us to set most every property value with
a single command. Because of this, we really only need that instance variable
for one property &ndash; the ensure value.  But let&rsquo;s start with the initialization
of that instance variable for the <code>flush</code> method:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def initialize(value={})
  super(value)
  @property_flush = {}
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The <code>initialize</code> method is magic to Ruby &ndash; it&rsquo;s invoked when you instantiate
a new object. In our case, we want to create a new instance variable &ndash;
<code>@property_flush</code> &ndash; that will be available to all methods of the instance of
the provider. This instance variable will be a hash and will contain all the
&lsquo;should&rsquo; values that will need to be synchronized for a resource. The <code>super</code>
method in Ruby sends a message to the parent of the current object, asking it
to invoke a method of the same name (e.g. <code>intialize</code>).  Basically, the
<code>initialize</code> method is doing the exact same thing as it has always done with
one exception &ndash; making the instance variable available to all methods of the
instance of the provider.</p>

<h3>The only &lsquo;setter&rsquo; method you need</h3>

<p>This provider is going to be unique not only because the <code>networksetup</code>
binary will set values for ALL properties, but because to change/set ANY
property values you have to change/set ALL the property values at the same
time. Typically, you&rsquo;ll see providers that will need to pass arguments to
a binary in order to set individual values.  For example, if you had a
binary <code>fooset</code> that took arguments of <code>--bar</code> and <code>--baz</code> to set values
respectively for <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code> properties of a resource, you might see the following
setter and flush methods for <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def bar=(value)
  @property_flush[:bar] = value
end</p>

<p>def baz=(value)
  @property_flush[:baz] = value
end</p>

<p>def flush
  array_arguments = []
  if @property_flush</p>

<pre><code>array_arguments &lt;&lt; '--bar' &lt;&lt; @property_flush[:bar] if @property_flush[:bar]
array_arguments &lt;&lt; '--baz' &lt;&lt; @property_flush[:baz] if @property_flush[:baz]
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  if ! array_arguments.empty?</p>

<pre><code>fooset(array_arguments, resource[:name])
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the case for <code>networksetup</code> &ndash; in fact, one of the ONLY places in our code
where we&rsquo;re going to throw a value inside <code>@property_flush</code> is going to be in
the <code>destroy</code> method. If our intention is to ensure a proxy absent (or, in
this case, disable the proxy for a network interface), then we can short-circuit
the method we&rsquo;re going to create to set proxy values by simply checking for
a value in <code>@property_flush[:ensure]</code>. Here&rsquo;s what the <code>destroy</code> method looks like:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def destroy
  @property_flush[:ensure] = :absent
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Next, we need a method that will set values for our proxy. This method will
handle all interaction to <code>networksetup</code>.  So, how do you set proxy values
with <code>networksetup</code>?</p>

<pre><code>networksetup -setwebproxy &lt;networkservice&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;port number&gt; &lt;authenticated&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The three properties to our <code>mac_web_proxy</code> type are <code>proxy_port</code>, <code>proxy_server</code>,
and <code>proxy_authenticated</code> which map to the &lsquo;&lt;port number>&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lt;domain>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;&lt;authenticated>&rsquo; values in this command. To change any of these values
means we have to pass ALL of these values (again, which is why our <code>flush</code>
implementation may be unique from other <code>flush</code> implementations). Here&rsquo;s what
the <code>set_proxy</code> method looks like:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def set_proxy
  if @property_flush[:ensure] == :absent</p>

<pre><code>  networksetup(['-setwebproxystate', resource[:name], 'off'])
  return
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  if (resource[:proxy_server].nil? or resource[:proxy_port].nil?)</p>

<pre><code>raise Puppet::Error, "Proxy types other than 'auto' require both a proxy_server and proxy_port setting"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  if resource[:proxy_authenticated] != :true</p>

<pre><code>networksetup(
  [
    '-setwebproxy',
    resource[:name],
    resource[:proxy_server],
    resource[:proxy_port]
  ]
)
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>networksetup(
  [
    '-setwebproxy',
    resource[:name],
    resource[:proxy_server],
    resource[:proxy_port],
    'on',
    resource[:authenticated_username],
    resource[:authenticated_password]
  ]
)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  networksetup([&lsquo;-setwebproxystate&rsquo;, resource[:name], &lsquo;on&rsquo;])
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>This helper method does all the validation checks for required properties,
executes the correct command, and enables the proxy. Now, let&rsquo;s implement
<code>flush</code>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def flush
  set_proxy</p>

<p>  # Collect the resources again once they&rsquo;ve been changed (that way <code>puppet
  # resource</code> will show the correct values after changes have been made).
  @property_hash = self.class.get_proxy_properties(resource[:name])
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The last line re-populates <code>@property_hash</code> with the current resource values,
and is necessary for <code>puppet resource</code> to return correct values after it
makes a change to a resource during a run.</p>

<h3>The final method</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve implemented logic to query the state of all resources, to prefetch those
states, to make changes to all properties at once, and to destroy a resource
if it exists, but we&rsquo;ve yet to implement logic to CREATE a resource if it
doesn&rsquo;t exist and it should.  Well, this is a bit of a lie &ndash; the logic is in
the code, but we don&rsquo;t have a <code>create</code> method, so Puppet&rsquo;s going to complain:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def create
  @property_flush[:ensure] = :present
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Technically, this method doesn&rsquo;t have to do a DAMN thing. Why? Remember how the
<code>flush</code> method is triggered when a resource&rsquo;s &lsquo;is&rsquo; values differ from its
&lsquo;should&rsquo; values? Also, remember how the <code>flush</code> method only calls the <code>set_proxy</code>
method? And, finally, remember how <code>set_proxy</code> only checks if
<code>@property_flush[:ensure] == :absent</code> (and if it doesn&rsquo;t, then it goes about
its merry way running <code>networksetup</code>)?  Right, well add these things up and
you&rsquo;ll realize that the <code>create</code> method is essentially meaningless based on our
implementation (but if you OMIT <code>create</code>, then Puppet&rsquo;s going to throw a shit-fit
in the shape of of a <code>Puppet::Error</code> exception):</p>

<pre><code>Error: /Mac_web_proxy[firewire]/ensure: change from absent to present failed: Could not set 'present' on ensure: undefined method `create' for Mac_web_proxy[firewire]:Puppet::Type::Mac_web_proxy
</code></pre>

<p>So make Puppet happy and write the goddamn <code>create</code> method, okay?</p>

<h2>The complete provider:</h2>

<p>Wow, that was a wild ride, huh?  If you&rsquo;ve been coding along, you should have
created a file that looks something like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby lib/puppet/provider/mac_web_proxy/ruby.rb %}
Puppet::Type.type(:mac_web_proxy).provide(:ruby) do

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.instances</p>

<pre><code>get_list_of_interfaces.collect do |int|

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there are better ways to write this Ruby code, no? Also, I&rsquo;m SURE
I have some errors/bugs in that code. It&rsquo;s those things that keep me in a job&hellip;</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>So, I write these posts not to belittle or mock anyone who works on Puppet
or wrote any of its implementation (except the amazing/terrifying bastard who
came up with <code>self.prefetch</code>). Anybody who contributes to open source and who
builds a tool to save some time for a bunch of sysadmins is fucking awesome
in my book.</p>

<p>No, I write these posts so that you can understand the <strong>&lsquo;WHY&rsquo;</strong> piece of the
puzzle. If you fuck up the <strong>&lsquo;HOW&rsquo;</strong> of the code, you can spend some time in
Google and IRB to figure it out, but if you don&rsquo;t understand the <strong>&lsquo;WHY&rsquo;</strong>
then you&rsquo;re probably not going to even bother.</p>

<p>Also, selfishly, I move from project to project so quickly that it&rsquo;s REALLY
easy to forget both why AND how I did what I did. Posts like these give me
someplace to point people when they ask me &ldquo;What&rsquo;s <code>self.prefetch</code>?&rdquo; that
ISN&rsquo;T just the source code or a liquor store.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the last post in the series, by the way. I haven&rsquo;t even TOUCHED
on writing unit tests for this code, so that&rsquo;s going to be a WHOLE other
piece altogether. Also, while this provider manages a <strong>WEB</strong> proxy for
a network interface, understand that there are MANY MORE kinds of proxies
for OS X network interfaces (including socks and gopher!). A future post
will show you how to refactor the above into a parent provider that can
be inherited to allow for code re-use among all the proxy providers that I
need to create.</p>

<p>As always, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to comment, ask questions, or simply bitch
at me both on this blog as well as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/glarizza">on Twitter: @glarizza</a>. Hopefully
this post helped you out and you learned a little bit more about how Puppet
providers do their dirty work&hellip;</p>

<p>Namaste, bitches.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that writing Puppet modules is the ultimate exercise in bikeshedding:
if it works, someone&rsquo;s probably going to tell you that you could have done it better,

in about 6 months, and good luck writing something that someone else can use cleanly

<h2>Data and Code Separation == bliss?</h2>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/puppetdata">I wrote a blog post about 2 years ago</a> detailing why separating
your data from your Puppet code was a good idea. The idea is still valid, which means
it&rsquo;s probably one of the better ideas I&rsquo;ve ever stolen (Does anyone want any HD-DVDs?).
Hunter Haugen and I <a href="http://bit.ly/hierablog">put together a quick blog post on using Hiera</a>
to solve the data/code problem because there wasn&rsquo;t a great bit of documentation on Hiera
at that point in time. Since then, Hiera&rsquo;s been widely accepted as &ldquo;a good idea&rdquo; and is
in use in production Puppet environments around the world. In most every environment,
usage of Hiera by more than just one person eventually gives birth to the question
that inspired this post:</p>

<h4>&ldquo;What the hell does and does NOT belong in Hiera?&rdquo;</h4>

<h2>Puppet data models</h2>

<h3>The params class pattern</h3>

<p>Many Puppet modules out there since Puppet 2.6 have begun using this pattern:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet puppetlabs-mysql/manifests/server.pp %}
class mysql::server (
  $config_file             = $mysql::params::config_file,
  $manage_config_file      = $mysql::params::manage_config_file,
  $old_root_password       = $mysql::params::old_root_password,
  $override_options        = {},
  $package_ensure          = $mysql::params::server_package_ensure,
  $package_name            = $mysql::params::server_package_name,
  $purge_conf_dir          = $mysql::params::purge_conf_dir,
  $remove_default_accounts = false,
  $restart                 = $mysql::params::restart,
  $root_group              = $mysql::params::root_group,
  $root_password           = $mysql::params::root_password,
  $service_enabled         = $mysql::params::server_service_enabled,
  $service_manage          = $mysql::params::server_service_manage,
  $service_name            = $mysql::params::server_service_name,
  $service_provider        = $mysql::params::server_service_provider,
  # Deprecated parameters
  $enabled                 = undef,
  $manage_service          = undef
) inherits mysql::params {</p>

<p>  ## Puppet goodness goes here
}</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar, this is a Puppet class definition for <code>mysql::server</code> that has several parameters
defined and defaulted to values that come out of the <code>mysql::params</code> class.  The
<code>mysql::params</code> class looks a bit like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet puppetlabs-mysql/manifests/params.pp %}
class mysql::params {
  case $::osfamily {</p>

<pre><code>'RedHat': {
  if $::operatingsystem == 'Fedora' and (is_integer($::operatingsystemrelease) and $::operatingsystemrelease &gt;= 19 or $::operatingsystemrelease == "Rawhide") {
    $client_package_name = 'mariadb'
    $server_package_name = 'mariadb-server'
  } else {
    $client_package_name = 'mysql'
    $server_package_name = 'mysql-server'
  }
  $basedir             = '/usr'
  $config_file         = '/etc/my.cnf'
  $datadir             = '/var/lib/mysql'
  $log_error           = '/var/log/mysqld.log'
  $pidfile             = '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid'
  $root_group          = 'root'
}

'Debian': {
  ## More parameters defined here
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>This pattern puts all conditional logic for all the variables/parameters used
in the module inside one class &ndash; the <code>mysql::params</code> class.  It&rsquo;s called the
&lsquo;params class pattern&rsquo; because we suck at naming things.</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>All conditional logic is in a single class</li>
<li>You always know which class to seek out if you need to change any of the logic used to determine a variable&rsquo;s value</li>
<li>You can use the include function because parameters for each class will be defaulted to the values that came out of the params class</li>
<li>If you need to override the value of a particular parameter, you can still use the parameterized class declaration syntax to do so</li>
<li>Anyone using Puppet version 2.6 or higher can use it (i.e. anyone who&rsquo;s been using Puppet since about 2010).</li>
</ul>


<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Conditional logic is repeated in every module</li>
<li>You will need to use inheritance to inherit parameter values in each subclass</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s another place to look if you ALSO use Hiera inside the module</li>
<li>Data is inside the manifest, so business logic is also inside params.pp</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hiera defaults pattern</h3>

<p>When Hiera hit the scene, one of the first things people tried to do was
to incorporate it into existing modules. The logic at that time was that
you could keep all parameter defaults inside Hiera, rid yourself of the
params class, and then just make Hiera calls out for your data. This
pattern looks like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet puppetlabs-mysql/manifests/server.pp %}
class mysql::server (
  $config_file             = hiera(&lsquo;mysql::params::config_file&rsquo;, &lsquo;default value&rsquo;),
  $manage_config_file      = hiera(&lsquo;mysql::params::manage_config_file&rsquo;, &lsquo;default value&rsquo;),
  $old_root_password       = hiera(&lsquo;mysql::params::old_root_password&rsquo;, &lsquo;default value&rsquo;),
  ## Repeat the above pattern
) {</p>

<p>  ## Puppet goodness goes here
}</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>All data is locked up in Hiera (and its multiple backends)</li>
<li>Default values can be provided if a Hiera lookup fails</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons:</h4>

<ul>
<li>You need to have Hiera installed, enabled, and configured to use this pattern</li>
<li>All data, including non-business logic, is in Hiera</li>
<li>If you use the default value, data could either come from Hiera OR the default (multiple places to look when debugging)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hybrid data model</h3>

<p>This pattern is for those people who want the portability of the params.pp class
combined with the power of Hiera. Because it&rsquo;s a hybrid, there are multiple ways
that people have set it up.  Here&rsquo;s a general example:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet puppetlabs-mysql/manifests/server.pp %}
class mysql::server (
  $config_file             = hiera(&lsquo;mysql::params::config_file&rsquo;, $mysql::params::config_file),
  $manage_config_file      = hiera(&lsquo;mysql::params::manage_config_file&rsquo;, $mysql::params::manage_config_file),
  $old_root_password       = hiera(&lsquo;mysql::params::old_root_password&rsquo;, $mysql::params::old_root_password),
  ## Repeat the above pattern
) inherits mysql::params {</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Data is sought from Hiera first and then defaulted back to the params class parameter</li>
<li>Keep non-business logic (i.e. OS specific data) in the params class and business logic in Hiera</li>
<li>Added benefits of both models</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Where did the variable get set &ndash; Hiera or the params class? Debugging can be hard</li>
<li>Requires Hiera to be setup to use the module</li>
<li>If you fudge a variable name in Hiera, you get the params class default &ndash; see Con #1</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hiera data bindings in Puppet 3.x.x</h3>

<p>In Puppet 3.0.0, there was a concept introduced called Data Bindings. This created
a federated data model automatically incorporating a Hiera lookup. Previously, the
order that Puppet would use to determine the value of a parameter was to first use
a value passed with the parameterized class declaration syntax (i.e. the below:).</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet parameterized class declaration %}
class { &lsquo;apache&rsquo;:
  package_name => &lsquo;httpd&rsquo;,
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>If a parameter was not passed with the parameterized class syntax (like the &lsquo;package_name&rsquo;
parameter above'), Puppet would then look for a default value inside the class definition
(i.e. the below:).</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet parameter default in a class definition %}
class ntp (
  $ntpserver = &lsquo;default.ntpserver.org&rsquo;
) {
  # Use $ntpserver in a file declaration&hellip;
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>If the value of &lsquo;ntpserver&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t passed with a parameterized class declaration,
then the value would be set to &lsquo;default.ntpserver.org&rsquo;, since that&rsquo;s the default
set in the above class definition.</p>

<p>Failing both of these conditions, Puppet would throw a parse error and say
that it couldn&rsquo;t determine a value for a class parameter.</p>

<p>As of Puppet 3.0.0, Puppet will now do a Hiera lookup for the fully namespaced
value of a class parameter</p>

<h3>Roles and Profiles</h3>

<p><a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2012/12/day-13-configuration-management-as-legos.html">The roles and profiles pattern</a> has been written about
a number of times and is ALSO considered to be &lsquo;a best practice&rsquo; when setting
up your Puppet environment. What roles and profiles gets you is a &lsquo;wrapper
class&rsquo; that allows you to declare classes within this wrapper class:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet profiles/manifests/wordpress.pp %}</p>

<p>class profiles::wordpress {
  # Data Lookups
  $site_name               = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::site_name&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_user_password = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_user_password&rsquo;)
  $mysql_root_password     = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::mysql_root_password&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_db_host       = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_db_host&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_db_name       = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_db_name&rsquo;)
  $wordpress_db_password   = hiera(&lsquo;profiles::wordpress::wordpress_db_password&rsquo;)</p>

<p>  ## Create user
  group { &lsquo;wordpress&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>ensure =&gt; present,
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  user { &lsquo;wordpress&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>ensure   =&gt; present,
gid      =&gt; 'wordpress',
password =&gt; $wordpress_user_password,
home     =&gt; '/var/www/wordpress',
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  ## Configure mysql
  class { &lsquo;mysql::server&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>root_password =&gt; $wordpress_root_password,
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  class { &lsquo;mysql::bindings&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>php_enable =&gt; true,
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  ## Configure apache
  include apache
  include apache::mod::php
}</p>

<h2>Continue with declarations&hellip;</h2>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Notice that any variables that might have business specific logic are set with
Hiera lookups. These Hiera lookups do NOT have default values, which means the
<code>hiera()</code> function will throw a parse error if a value is not returned. This
is IDEAL because we WANT TO KNOW if a Hiera lookup fails &ndash; this means we failed
to put the data in Hiera and should be corrected BEFORE a state that might
contain invalid data is enforced with Puppet.</p>

<p>You then have a &lsquo;Role&rsquo; wrapper class that simply includes many of the &lsquo;Profile&rsquo;
wrapper classes:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet roles/manifests/frontend.pp %}
class roles::frontend {
  include profiles::mysql
  include profiles::apache
  include profiles::java
  include profiles::jboss
  # include more profiles&hellip;
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The idea being that Profiles abstract all the technical bits that need to
declared to setup a piece of technology, and Roles will abstract all the
business logic for what pieces of technology should be installed on a certain
&lsquo;class&rsquo; of machine.  Basically, you can say that &ldquo;all our frontend infrastructure
should have mysql, apache, java, jboss&hellip;&rdquo;.  In this statement, the Role is
&lsquo;frontend infrastructure&rsquo; and the Profiles are &lsquo;mysql, apache, java, jboss&hellip;&rsquo;.</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Hiera data lookups are confined to a wrapper class OUTSIDE of the component modules (like mysql, apache, java, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li>Data lookups for parameters containing business logic are done with Hiera</li>
<li>Non-business specific data is pulled from the module (i.e. the params class)</li>
<li>Wrapper modules can be &lsquo;included&rsquo; with the <code>include</code> function, helping to eliminate multiple class declarations using the parameterized class declaration syntax</li>
<li>Component modules are backward-compatible to Puppet 2.6 while wrapper modules still get to use a modern data lookup mechanism (Hiera)</li>
<li>Component modules do NOT contain any business specific logic, which means they&rsquo;re portable</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Hiera must be setup to use the wrapper modules</li>
<li>Wrapper modules add another debug path for variable data</li>
<li>Wrapper modules add another layer of abstraction</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data in Puppet Modules</h2>

<p>R.I. Pienaar (the original author of MCollective, Hiera, and much more)
<a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2013/12/08/better-puppet-modules-using-hiera-data.php">published a blog post</a>
recently on implementing a folder for Puppet modules that Hiera can traverse
when it does data lookups. This construct isn&rsquo;t new,
<a href="https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/16856">there was a feature request</a>
for this behavior filed in October of 2012 with a
<a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/1217">subsequent pull request</a>
that implemented this functionality (they&rsquo;re both worth reads for further
information). The pull request didn&rsquo;t get merged, and so R.I. implemented
the functionality <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/ripienaar/module_data">inside a module on the Puppet Forge</a>.
In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s a hiera.yaml configuration file INSIDE THE MODULE that
implements a module-specific hierarchy, and a &lsquo;data&rsquo; folder (also inside
the module) that allows for individual YAML files that Hiera could read.
This hierarchy is consulted AFTER the site-specific <code>hiera.yaml</code> file
is read (i.e. <code>/etc/puppet/hiera.yaml</code> or <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml</code>),
and the in-module data files are consulted AFTER the site-specific Hiera
data files are read (normally found in either <code>/etc/puppet/hieradata</code> or
<code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hieradata</code>).</p>

<p>The argument here is that there&rsquo;s a data store for <strong>SITE-SPECIFIC</strong> Hiera
data that should be kept outside of modules, but there&rsquo;s not a <strong>MODULE-SPECIFIC</strong>
data store that Hiera can use. The argument isn&rsquo;t whether data that should be
shared with other people belongs inside a site-specific Hiera datastore
(protip: it doesn&rsquo;t. Data that&rsquo;s not business-specific should be shared
with others and kept inside the module), the argument is that it shouldn&rsquo;t
be locked up inside the DSL where the barrier-to-entry is learning Puppet&rsquo;s
DSL syntax. Whereas <code>/etc/puppet/hiera.yaml</code> or <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml</code>
sets up the hierarchy for all your site-specific data, there&rsquo;s no per-module
<code>hiera.yaml</code> file for all module-specific data, and there&rsquo;s no place to put
module-specific Hiera data.</p>

<h4>But module-specific data goes inside the params class and business-specific data goes inside Hiera, right?</h4>

<p>Sure, but for some people the Puppet DSL is a barrier. The argument is that
there should be a lower barrier to entry to contribute parameter data
to Puppet that doesn&rsquo;t require you to learn the syntax of if/case/selector
statements in the Puppet DSL. There&rsquo;s also the argument that if you want
to add support for an operatingsystem to your module, you have to modify
the params class file and add another entry to the if/case/selector
statement &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to just add another YAML file into
a data folder that doesn&rsquo;t affect existing datafiles?</p>

<h4>Great, ANOTHER hierarchy to traverse for data &ndash; that&rsquo;s going to get confusing</h4>

<p>Well, think about it right now &ndash; most EVERY params class of EVERY module
(if it supports multiple operatingsystems)
does some sort of conditional logic to determine values for parameters
on a per-OS basis. That&rsquo;s something that you need to traverse. And many
modules use different conditional data to determine what paramters to use. Look
at the mysql params class example above &ndash; it not only splits on
<code>$osfamily</code>, but it also checks specific operatingsystems. That&rsquo;s a
conditional inside a conditional. You&rsquo;re TRAVERSING conditional data
right now to find a value &ndash; the only difference is that this method
doesn&rsquo;t use the DSL, it uses Hiera and YAML.</p>

<h4>Sure, but this is outside of Puppet and you&rsquo;re losing visibility inside Puppet with your data</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;re already doing that if you&rsquo;re using the params class. In this case, visibility is
moved to YAML files instead of separate Puppet classes.</p>

<h3>Setting it up</h3>

<p>You will first need to install R.I.&rsquo;s module from the Puppet Forge. As of
this writing, it&rsquo;s version <code>0.0.1</code>, so ensure you have the most recent
version using the <code>puppet module</code> tool:</p>

<pre><code>[root@linux modules]# puppet module install ripienaar/module_data

</code></pre>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to setup a module to use the data-in-modules pattern. Take
a look at the tree of a sample module:</p>

<pre><code>[root@linux modules]# tree mysql/
mysql/
├── data
│   ├── hiera.yaml
│   └── RedHat.yaml
└── manifests
    └── init.pp
</code></pre>

<p>I created a sample <code>mysql</code> module based on the examples above. All of
the module&rsquo;s Hiera data (including the module-specific hiera.yaml file)
goes in the <code>data</code> folder. This module should be placed in Puppet&rsquo;s
modulepath &ndash; and if you don&rsquo;t know where Puppet&rsquo;s modulepath is set,
run the <code>puppet config</code> face to determine that:</p>

<pre><code>[root@linux modules]# puppet config print modulepath
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules:/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules
</code></pre>

<p>In my case, I&rsquo;m putting the module in <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules</code>
(since I&rsquo;m running Puppet Enterprise). Here&rsquo;s the hiera.yaml file
from the sample mysql module:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:yaml mysql/data/hiera.yaml %}
:hierarchy:
  &ndash; &ldquo;%{::osfamily}&rdquo;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also included a YAML file for the <code>$osfamily</code> of RedHat:</p>

<h2>{% codeblock lang:yaml mysql/data/RedHat.yaml %}</h2>

<p>mysql::config_file: &lsquo;/path/from/data_in_modules&rsquo;
mysql::manage_config_file: true
mysql::old_root_password: &lsquo;password_from_data_in_modules&rsquo;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s what the mysql class definition looks like from
<code>manifests/init.pp</code>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet mysql/manifests/init.pp %}
class mysql (
  $config_file        = &lsquo;module_default&rsquo;,
  $manage_config_file = &lsquo;module_default&rsquo;,
  $old_root_password  = &lsquo;module_default&rsquo;
) {
  notify { &ldquo;The value of config_file: ${config_file}&rdquo;: }
  notify { &ldquo;The value of manage_config_file: ${manage_config_file}&rdquo;: }
  notify { &ldquo;The value of old_root_password: ${old_root_password}&rdquo;: }
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Everything should be setup to notify the value of a couple of parameters.
Now, to test it out&hellip;</p>

<h3>Testing data-in-modules</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s include the mysql class with <code>puppet apply</code> to see where it&rsquo;s looking
for data:</p>

<pre><code>[root@linux modules]# puppet apply -e 'include mysql'
Notice: The value of config_file: /path/from/data_in_modules
Notice: /Stage[main]/Mysql/Notify[The value of config_file: /path/from/data_in_modules]/message: defined 'message' as 'The value of config_file: /path/from/data_in_modules'
Notice: The value of manage_config_file: true
Notice: /Stage[main]/Mysql/Notify[The value of manage_config_file: true]/message: defined 'message' as 'The value of manage_config_file: true'
Notice: The value of old_root_password: password_from_data_in_modules
Notice: /Stage[main]/Mysql/Notify[The value of old_root_password: password_from_data_in_modules]/message: defined 'message' as 'The value of old_root_password: password_from_data_in_modules'
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.62 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m running on an operatingsystem whose family is &lsquo;RedHat&rsquo; (i.e. CentOS),
you can see that the values of all the parameters were pulled from the Hiera
data files inside the module.  Let&rsquo;s temporarily change the <code>$osfamily</code> fact
value and see what happens:</p>

<pre><code>[root@linux modules]# FACTER_osfamily=Debian puppet apply -e 'include mysql'
Notice: The value of config_file: module_default
Notice: /Stage[main]/Mysql/Notify[The value of config_file: module_default]/message: defined 'message' as 'The value of config_file: module_default'
Notice: The value of old_root_password: module_default
Notice: /Stage[main]/Mysql/Notify[The value of old_root_password: module_default]/message: defined 'message' as 'The value of old_root_password: module_default'
Notice: The value of manage_config_file: module_default
Notice: /Stage[main]/Mysql/Notify[The value of manage_config_file: module_default]/message: defined 'message' as 'The value of manage_config_file: module_default'
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.51 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>This time, when I specified a value of <code>Debian</code> for <code>$osfamily</code>, the parameter
values were pulled from the declaration in the mysql class definition (i.e.
from inside <code>mysql/manifests/init.pp</code>).</p>

<h3>Testing outside of Puppet</h3>

<p>One of the big pros of Hiera is that it comes with the <code>hiera</code> binary that can
be run from the command line to test values. This works just fine for site-specific
module data that&rsquo;s defined in the central <code>hiera.yaml</code> file that&rsquo;s usually defined
in <code>/etc/puppet</code> or <code>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet</code>, but the data-in-modules pattern relies
on a Puppet indirector to point to the current module&rsquo;s <code>data</code> folder, and thus
(as of right now) there&rsquo;s not a simple way to run the <code>hiera</code> binary to pull
data out of modules WITHOUT running Puppet. This is not a dealbreaker, and
doesn&rsquo;t stop anybody from hacking up something that WILL look inside modules
for data, but as of right now it doesn&rsquo;t yet exist. It also makes debugging for
values that come out of modules a bit more difficult.</p>

<h3>The scorecard for data-in-modules</h3>

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Parameters are defined in YAML and not Puppet DSL (i.e. you only need to know YAML and not the Puppet DSL)</li>
<li>Adding parameters is as simple as adding another YAML file to the module</li>
<li>Module authors provide module data that can be read by Puppet 3.x.x Hiera data bindings</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cons:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Must be using Puppet 3.0.0 or higher</li>
<li>Additional hierarchy and additional Hiera data file to consult when debugging</li>
<li>Not (currently) an easy/straightforward way to use the <code>hiera</code> binary to test values</li>
<li>Currently depends on a Puppet Forge module being installed on your system</li>
</ul>


<h2>What are you trying to say?</h2>

<p>I am ALL ABOUT code portability, re-usability, and not building 500 apache modules.
Ever since people have been building modules, they&rsquo;ve been putting too much data
inside modules (to the point where they can&rsquo;t share them with anyone else). I
can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;We have a module for that, but I can&rsquo;t
share it because it has all our company-specific data in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conversely, I&rsquo;ve also seen organizations put EVERYTHING in their site-specific
Hiera datastore because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the place for Puppet data.&rdquo; They usually end up
with 15+ levels in their Hiera hierarchies because they&rsquo;re doing things like
this:</p>

<h2>{% codeblock lang:yaml hiera.yaml %}</h2>

<p>:backends:
  &ndash; yaml</p>

<p>:hierarchy:
  &ndash; &ldquo;%{clientcert}&rdquo;
  &ndash; &ldquo;%{environment}&rdquo;
  &ndash; &ldquo;%{osfamily}&rdquo;
  &ndash; &ldquo;%{osfamily}/%{operatingsystem}&rdquo;
  &ndash; &ldquo;%{osfamily}/%{operatingsystem}/%{os_version_major}&rdquo;
  &ndash; &ldquo;%{osfamily}/%{operatingsystem}/%{os_version_minor}&rdquo;
  # Repeat until you have 15 levels of WTF
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>This leads us back again to &ldquo;What does and DOESN&rsquo;T go in Hiera?&rdquo;
I usually say the following:</p>

<h4>Data in site-specific Hiera datastore</h4>

<ul>
<li>Business-specific data (i.e. internal NTP server, VIP address, per-environment java application versions, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li>Sensitive data</li>
<li>Data that you don&rsquo;t want to share with anyone else</li>
</ul>


<h4>Data that does NOT go in the site-specific Hiera datastore</h4>

<ul>
<li>OS-specific data</li>
<li>Data that EVERYONE ELSE who uses this module will need to know (paths to config files, package names, etc&hellip;)</li>
</ul>


<p>Basically, if I ask you if I can publish your module to <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com">the Puppet Forge</a>,
and you object because it has business-specific or sensitive data in it, then
you probably need to pull that data out of the module and put it in Hiera.</p>

<p>The recommendations that I give when I go on-site with Puppet users is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Roles/Profiles to create wrapper-classes for class declaration</li>
<li>Do ALL Hiera lookups for site-specific data inside your &lsquo;Profile&rsquo; wrapper classes</li>
<li>All module-specific data (like paths to config files, names of packages to install, etc&hellip;) should be kept in the module in the params class</li>
<li>All &lsquo;Role&rsquo; wrapper classes should just <strong>include</strong> &lsquo;Profile&rsquo; wrapper classes &ndash; nothing else</li>
</ul>


<h2>But what about Data in Modules?</h2>

<p>I went through all the trouble of writing up the Data in Modules pattern,
but I didn&rsquo;t recommend or even MENTION it in the previous section. The reason
is NOT because I don&rsquo;t believe in it (I actually think the future will be data
outside of the DSL inside a Puppet module), the reason is because it&rsquo;s not <strong>YET</strong>
in Puppet&rsquo;s core and because it&rsquo;s not <strong>YET</strong> been widely tested. If you&rsquo;re an
existing Puppet user that&rsquo;s been looking for a way to split data outside of
the DSL, here is your opportunity. Use the pattern and PLEASE report back on what
you like and don&rsquo;t like about it. The functionality is in a module, so it&rsquo;s
easy to tweak. If you&rsquo;re new to Puppet and are comfortable with the DSL, then
the params class exists and is available to you.</p>

<p>To voice your opinion or to follow the progress of data in modules,
<a href="https://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/16856">follow or comment on this Puppet ticket.</a></p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2013/12/09/the-problem-with-params-pp.php">R.I. posted another article on the problem with params.pp</a>
that is worth reading. He gives compelling reasons on why he built Hiera, why
params.pp WORKS, but also why he believes it&rsquo;s not the future of Puppet. R.I.
goes even further to explain that it&rsquo;s not necessarily the Puppet DSL that is
the barrier to entry, it&rsquo;s that this sort of data belongs in a file for config
data and not INSIDE THE CODE itself (i.e. inside the Puppet DSL). Providing data
inside modules gives module authors a way to provide this configuration data
in files that AREN&rsquo;T the Puppet DSL (i.e. not inside the code).</p>

    <updated>2013-11-26T16:01:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/11/26/fun-with-providers-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously, on Lost, I said a lot of words about Puppet Types;
<a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/11/25/fun-with-providers/">you should totally check it out.</a>
In this second installment, you&rsquo;re going to find out how to actually throw
pure Ruby at Puppet in a way that makes you feel accomplished. And useful. And elitist.
Well, possibly just elitist. Either way, read on &ndash; there&rsquo;s much thought-leadership to be done&hellip;</p>

<p>In the last post, we learned that Types will essentially dictate the attributes
that you&rsquo;ll be passing in your resource declaration using the DSL. In the
simplest and crudest explanation I could muster, types model how your
declaration will look in the manifest. Providers are where the actual
IMPLEMENTATION happens. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:puppet %}
package { &lsquo;httpd&rsquo;:
  ensure => installed,
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>eventually gets turned into this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
yum install -e 0 -d 0 -y httpd
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>your answer would be &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the provider file&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Dirty black magic</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people do the craziest shit imaginable in the Puppet DSL simply because
they&rsquo;re:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unsure how types and providers work</li>
<li>Afraid of Ruby</li>
<li>Confused by error messages</li>
<li>Afraid to ask for help</li>
</ul>


<p>Sometimes you have a problem that can only be solved by interacting with data
that&rsquo;s returned by a binary (using some binary to get a value, and then using
that binary to set a value, and so on&hellip;). I see people writing defined resource
types with a SHIT TON of <code>exec</code> statements and conditional logic to model this
data when a type and provider would not only BETTER model the problem but would
also be shareable and re-useable by other folk. The issue is that while the DSL
is REALLY easy to get started with, types and providers still feel like dirty
black magic.</p>

<p>The reason is because they&rsquo;re dirty black magic.</p>

<p>Hopefully, I can help get you over the hump and onto a working implementation. Let&rsquo;s
take a problem I had last week:</p>

<h2>Do this if that, and then be done</h2>

<p>I was working with a group who wanted to set a list of domains that would
bypass their web proxy for a specific network interface on an OS X workstation.
It sounds so simple, because it was. Due to the amount of time I had on-site,
I wrote a class with some nasty <code>exec</code> statements, a couple of facts, and some
conditional logic because that&rsquo;s what you do when you&rsquo;re in a hurry&hellip;but it
doesn&rsquo;t make it right. When I left, I hacked up a type and provider, and it&rsquo;s
a GREAT example because you probably have a similar problem.  Let&rsquo;s look at the
information we have:</p>

<p>The list of network interfaces:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
└▷ networksetup -listallnetworkservices
An asterisk (*) denotes that a network service is disabled.
Bluetooth DUN
Display Ethernet
Ethernet
FireWire
Wi-Fi
iPhone USB
Bluetooth PAN
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Getting the list of bypass domains for an interface:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
└▷ networksetup -getproxybypassdomains Ethernet
www.garylarizza.com
*.corp.net
10.13.1.3/24
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The message displayed when no domains are set for an interface:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
└▷ networksetup -getproxybypassdomains FireWire
There aren&rsquo;t any bypass domains set on FireWire.
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Setting the list of bypass domains for an interface:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
└▷ networksetup -setproxybypassdomains Ethernet &lsquo;*.corp.net&rsquo; &lsquo;10.13.1.3/24&rsquo; &lsquo;www.garylarizza.com&rsquo;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Perfect &ndash; all of that is done with a single binary, and it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward. Let&rsquo;s look at the type I ended up creating for this problem:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lib/puppet/type/mac_proxy_bypassdomains.rb lang:ruby %}
Puppet::Type.newtype(:mac_proxy_bypassdomains) do
  desc &ldquo;Puppet type that models bypass domains for a network interface on OS X&rdquo;</p>

<p>  ensurable</p>

<p>  newparam(:name, :namevar => true) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Interface name - currently must be 'friendly' name (e.g. Ethernet)"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  newproperty(:domains, :array_matching => :all) do</p>

<pre><code>desc "Domains which should bypass the proxy"
def insync?(is)
  is.sort == should.sort
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The type uses a namevar parameter called &lsquo;name&rsquo;, which is the name of the network interface.
This means that we can set one list of bypass domains for every network interface.
There&rsquo;s a single property, &lsquo;domains&rsquo; that accepts an array of domains that should bypass
the proxy for the network interface. I&rsquo;ve overridden the <code>insync?</code> method for the domains
property to sort the array values on both ends &ndash; this means that the ORDER of the domains
doesn&rsquo;t matter, I only care that the domains specified exist on the system. Finally, the
type is ensurable (which means that we can create a list of domains and remove/destroy
the list of domains for a network interface).</p>

<h2>Setup the provider</h2>

<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve defined the problem, seen how to interact with the system to get us the
data that we need, setup a type to model the data, and now the last thing left to do
is to wire up the provider to make the binary calls we need and return the data we
want.</p>

<h3>Typos are not your friend.</h3>

<p>The first thing you will encounter is &ldquo;Puppet&rsquo;s predictable naming pattern&rdquo;
that is used by the Puppet autoloader. Typos are not fun, and omitting a single
letter in either the filename or the provider name will render your provider
(emotionally) unavailable to Puppet. Our type is called &lsquo;mac_proxy_bypassdomains&rsquo;,
as types are generally named along the lines of &lsquo;what does this data model?&rsquo; The
provider name is generally the name of the underlying technology that&rsquo;s doing
the modeling. For the package type, the providers are named after the package
management systems (e.g. yum, apt, pacman, zypper, pip), for the file type, the
providers are loosely named for the operatingsystem kernel type on which files
are to be created (e.g. windows, posix). In our example, I simply chose to name
the provider &lsquo;ruby&rsquo; because, as a Puppet Labs employee, <strong>I TOO</strong> suck at naming
things.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a tree of my module to understand how the type and provider files are
to be laid out:</p>

<p>{% codeblock Module tree lang:bash %}
├── Modulefile
├── README.markdown
└── lib
    └── puppet
        ├── provider
        │   ├── mac_proxy_bypassdomains
        │   │   └── ruby.rb
        └── type
            └── mac_proxy_bypassdomains.rb
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>As you can see from above, the name of both the type and provider must <strong>EXACTLY</strong>
match the filename of their corresponding files. Also, the provider file lives
in a directory named after the type. There are MANY things that can be typoed here
(filenames, foldernames, type/provider names in their files), so be absolutely sure
that you&rsquo;ve named your files correctly.</p>

<p>The reason for all this naming bullshit is because of the way Puppet syncs down
plugin files (coincidentally, with a <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/plugins_in_modules.html">process known as Pluginsync)</a>.
Everything in the <code>lib</code> directory in a Puppet module is going to get synced down
to your nodes inside <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html#vardir">the <code>vardir</code> directory</a> on
the node itself. The <code>vardir</code> is a known library path to Puppet, and all files
in the <code>vardir</code> are treated as if they had lived in Puppet&rsquo;s source code (in
the same relative paths).  Because the Puppet source code has all type files in
the <code>lib/puppet/type</code> directory, all <strong>CUSTOM</strong> types must go in the module&rsquo;s
<code>lib/puppet/type</code> directory for confirmity.  This is repeated for <strong>EVERY</strong>
custom Puppet/Facter plugin (including custom facts, custom functions, and
etc&hellip;).</p>

<h3>More scaffolding</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s layout the shell of our provider, first, to ensure that we haven&rsquo;t typoed
anything. Here&rsquo;s the provider declaration:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lib/puppet/type/mac_proxy_bypassdomains/ruby.rb lang:ruby %}
Puppet::Type.type(:mac_proxy_bypassdomains).provide(:ruby) do
  # Provider work goes here
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Note that the name of the type and the name of the provider are symbolized (i.e.
they&rsquo;re prepended with a colon). Like I mentioned above, they must be spelled
EXACT or Puppet will complain very loudly. You may see variants on that
declaration line because there are multiple ways in Ruby to extend a class
object. The method I&rsquo;ve listed above is the &lsquo;generally accepted best-practice&rsquo;, which
is to say it&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re doing it this month.</p>

<p>Congrats! You have THE SHELL of a provider that has yet to do a single goddamn thing!
Technically, you&rsquo;re further than about 90% of other Puppet users at this point! Let&rsquo;s
go the additional 20% (since we&rsquo;re basing this on a mangement metric of 110%) by
wiring up the methods and making the damn thing work!</p>

<h3>Are you (en)sure about this?</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve explained before that a type is &lsquo;ensurable&rsquo; when you can check for its existance
on a system, create it when it doesn&rsquo;t exist (and it SHOULD exist), and destroy it when
it does exist (and it SHOULDN&rsquo;T exist). The bare minimum amount of methods necessary
to make a type ensurable is three, and they&rsquo;re called <code>exists?</code>, <code>create</code>, and <code>destroy</code>.</p>

<h3>Method: <code>exists?</code></h3>

<p>The <code>exists?</code> method is a predicate method &ndash; that means it should either return
the boolean <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value based on whether the bypass domain list
exists. Puppet will always call the <code>exists?</code> provider method to determine if
that &lsquo;thing&rsquo; (in this case, &lsquo;thing&rsquo; means &lsquo;a list of domains to bypass for a
specific network interface&rsquo;) exists before calling any other methods. How do we
know if this thing exists? Like I showed before, you need to run the
<code>networksetup -getproxybypassdomains</code> command and pass the interface name.  If
it returns &lsquo;There aren&rsquo;t any bypass domains set on (interface name)&rsquo;, then the
list doesn&rsquo;t exist. Let&rsquo;s do some binary execution&hellip;</p>

<h4>Calling binaries from Puppet</h4>

<p>Puppet provides some helper syntax around basic actions that most providers
perform. MOST providers are going to need to call out to an external binary
(e.g. yum, apt, etc&hellip;) at some point, and so Puppet allows you to create
your own method JUST for a system binary. The <code>commands</code> method abstracts
all the dirtyness of making a method for each system binary you want to call.
The way you use the <code>commands</code> method is like so:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
commands :networksetup => &lsquo;networksetup&rsquo;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The <code>commands</code> method accepts a hash whose key must be a symbolized name. The
CONVENTION is to use a symbolized name that matches the binary name, but it&rsquo;s
not REQUIRED to do so. The value for that symbolized key MUST be the binary
name. Note that I&rsquo;ve not passed a full path to the binary. Why? Well, Puppet
will automatically do a path lookup for that binary and store its full path
for use when the binary is invoked. We don&rsquo;t REQUIRE you to pass the full
path because sometimes the same binary exists in different locations for
different operatingsystems. Instead of creating a provider for each OS you
manage with Puppet, we abstract away the path stuff. You <strong>CAN</strong> still
pass a full path as a value, but if you elect to do that an the binary doesn&rsquo;t
exist at that path, Puppet will disqualify the provider and you&rsquo;ll be quite
upset.</p>

<p>In the event that Puppet <strong>CANNOT</strong> find this binary, it will disqualify the
entire provider, and you&rsquo;ll get a message saying as much in the debug output
of your Puppet run. Because of that, the <code>commands</code> method is a good way to
confine your provider to a specific system or class of system.</p>

<p>When the <code>commands</code> method is successfully invoked, you will get a new provider
method named after the <strong>SYMBOLIZED</strong> key, and not necessarily the binary
name (unless you made them the same). After the above command is evaluated,
Puppet will now have a <code>networksetup()</code> method in our provider. The argument
to the <code>networksetup</code> method should be an array of arguments that are passed
to the binary. It&rsquo;s c-style, so each element is going to be individually
quoted. You can run into issues here if you pass values containing quotes
as part of your argument array. Read that again &ndash; quoting your values is
totally acceptable (e.g. [&lsquo;foo&rsquo;, &lsquo;bar&rsquo;]), but passing a value that contains
quotes can potentially cause problems (e.g. [&ldquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&lsquo;bar&rsquo;&rdquo;]).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking &ldquo;Why the hell would I go through this trouble when
I can use the <code>%x{}</code> syntax in ruby to execute a shell command?!&rdquo; And to that
I would say &ldquo;Quit yelling at me&rdquo; and also &ldquo;Because: testing.&rdquo; When you write
spec tests for your provider (which will be covered in a later blog post, since
it&rsquo;s its OWN path of WTF), you&rsquo;re going to need to mock out calls to the system
during your tests (i.e. sometimes you may be running the tests on a system that
doesn&rsquo;t have the binary you&rsquo;re meant to be calling in your provider. You don&rsquo;t
want the tests to fail due to the absence of a binary file). The <code>%x{}</code>
construct in Ruby is hard to mock out, but a method of our provider is a relatively
easy thing to mock out. Also &ndash; see the path problem above. We don&rsquo;t STOP you
from doing <code>%x{}</code> in your code (it will still totally work), but we give you
a couple of good reasons to NOT do it.</p>

<h4>Objects are a provider&rsquo;s best friend</h4>

<p>Within your provider, you&rsquo;re going to be doing lots of system calls and data
manipulation. Often we&rsquo;re asked whether you do that ugliness inside the main
methods (i.e. inside the <code>exists?</code> method directly), or if you create a
helper method for some of this data manipulation. The answer I usually give
is that you should probably create a helper method if:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code is going to be called more than once</li>
<li>The code does something that would be tricky to test (like reading from a file)</li>
<li>Complexity would be reduced by creating a helper method</li>
</ul>


<p>The act of getting a list of domains for a specific interface is definitely
going to be utilized in more than one place in our provider (we&rsquo;ll use it
in the <code>exists?</code> method as well as in a &lsquo;getter&rsquo; method for the <code>domains</code>
property). Also, you could argue that it might be tricky to test since it&rsquo;s
going to be a binary call that&rsquo;s going to return some data. Because of this,
let&rsquo;s create a helper method that returns a list of domains for a specific
interface:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def get_proxy_bypass_domains(int)
  begin</p>

<pre><code>output = networksetup(['-getproxybypassdomains', int])
</code></pre>

<p>  rescue Puppet::ExecutionFailure => e</p>

<pre><code>Puppet.debug("#get_proxy_bypass_domains had an error -&gt; #{e.inspect}")
return nil
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  domains = output.split(&ldquo;\n&rdquo;).sort
  return nil if domains.first =~ /There aren\&rsquo;t any bypass domains set/
  domains
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Ruby convention is to use underscores (i.e. versus camelCase or hyphens) in
method names. You want to give your methods very descriptive names based on
what it is that they DO. In this case, <code>get_proxy_bypass_domains</code> seems
adequately descriptive. Also, you should err on the side of readability when
you&rsquo;re writing code. You can get pretty creative with Ruby metaprogramming,
but that can quickly become hard to follow (and then you&rsquo;re just a dick).
Finally, error-handling is a good thing. If you&rsquo;re going to do any error-handling,
though, be very specific about the errors you catch/rescue. When you have a rescue
block, make sure you catch a specific exception class (in the case above, we&rsquo;re
catching a Puppet::ExecutionFailure &ndash; which means the binary is returning a
non-zero exit code).</p>

<p>The code above will return an array containing all the domains, or it will
return <code>nil</code> if domains aren&rsquo;t found or the <code>networksetup</code> binary had an issue.</p>

<p>Using the helper method above, here&rsquo;s what the final <code>exists?</code> method looks like:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def exists?
  get_proxy_bypass_domains(resource[:name]) != nil
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>All provider methods have the ability to access the &lsquo;should&rsquo; values for the resource
(and by that I mean the values that are set in the Puppet maniest on the Puppet master
server, or locally if you&rsquo;re using <code>puppet apply</code>). Those values reside in the <code>resource</code>
method that responds with a hash. In the code above, <code>resource[:name]</code> will return the
network interface name (e.g. Ethernet, FireWire, etc&hellip;) that was specified in the
Puppet manifest. The exists method will return true of a list of domains exists for
an interface, or it will return false if a list of domains does not exist (i.e.
<code>get_proxy_bypass_domains</code> returns <code>nil</code>).</p>

<h3>Method: <code>create</code></h3>

<p>The <code>create</code> method is called when <code>exists?</code> returns false and a resource has an
<code>ensure</code> value set to <code>present</code>. Because of this, you don&rsquo;t need to call the <code>exists?</code>
method explicitly in <code>create</code> &ndash; it&rsquo;s already been evaluated. Remember from above that
the <code>-setproxybypassdomains</code> argument to the <code>networksetup</code> binary will set a domain
list, so the <code>create</code> method is going to be very short-and-sweet:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def create
  networksetup([&lsquo;-setproxybypassdomains&rsquo;, resource[:name], resource[:domains]])
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>In the end, the <code>create</code> method will call the <code>networksetup</code> binary with the <code>-setproxybypassdomains</code>
argument, pass the interface name (from <code>resource[:name]</code>) and pass an array of domain values (which
comes from <code>resource[:domains]</code>). That&rsquo;s it; it&rsquo;s done!</p>

<h3>Method: <code>destroy</code></h3>

<p>The <code>destroy</code> method is easier than the <code>create</code> method:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def destroy
  networksetup([&lsquo;-setproxybypassdomains&rsquo;, nil])
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Here, we&rsquo;re calling <code>networksetup</code> with the <code>-setproxybypassdomains</code> argument
and passing nothing else. This will initialize the list and set it to be empty.</p>

<h2>Synchronizing properties</h2>

<h3>Getter method: <code>domains</code></h3>

<p>At this point our type is ensurable, which means we can create and destroy resources.
What we CAN&rsquo;T do, however, is change the value of any properties that are out-of-sync. A
property is out-of-sync when the value discovered by Puppet on the node differs from the
value in the catalog (i.e. set by the Puppet manifest using the DSL on the Puppet master).
Just like <code>exists?</code> is called to determine if a resource exists, Puppet needs a way to
get the current value for a property on a node. The method that gets this value is
called the &lsquo;getter method&rsquo; for a property, and its name must match the name of the
property. Because we have a property called <code>domains</code>, the provider must have a <code>domains</code>
method that returns a value (in this case, an array of domains to be bypassed by the
proxy). We&rsquo;ve already written a helper method that does this work for us, so the
<code>domains</code> getter method is pretty easy:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def domains
  get_proxy_bypass_domains(resource[:name])
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Tada! Just call the helper method and pass the interface name. Boom &ndash; instant array
of values. The getter method will return the &lsquo;is&rsquo; value, because that&rsquo;s what the value
<strong>IS</strong> (currently on the node). Get it? Anyone? The <strong>IS</strong> value is the other side of
the coin to the &lsquo;should&rsquo; value (that comes from the Puppet manifest) because that&rsquo;s
what the value <strong>SHOULD</strong> be set on the node.</p>

<h3>Setter method: <code>domains=</code></h3>

<p>If the getter method (e.g. <code>domains</code>) returns a value that doesn&rsquo;t match the value
in the catalog, then Puppet changes the value on the node and sets it to the value
in the catalog. It does this by calling the &lsquo;setter&rsquo; method for the property, which
is the name of the property and the equals ( = ) sign. In this case, the setter
method for the <code>domains</code> property must be called <code>domains=</code>.  It looks like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def domains=(value)
  networksetup([&lsquo;-setproxybypassdomains&rsquo;, resource[:name], value])
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Setter methods are always passed a single argument &ndash; the &lsquo;should&rsquo; value of the property.
In our example, we&rsquo;re calling the <code>networksetup</code> binary with the <code>-setproxybypassdomains</code>
argument, passing the name of the interface, and then passing the &lsquo;should&rsquo; value &ndash; or
the array of domains. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s one line, and I love it when a plan comes together</p>

<h2>Putting the whole damn thing together</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve broken down the provider line by line, but here&rsquo;s the entire file:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lib/puppet/provider/mac_proxy_bypassdomains/ruby.rb lang:ruby %}
Puppet::Type.type(:mac_proxy_bypassdomains).provide(:ruby) do
  commands :networksetup => &lsquo;networksetup&rsquo;</p>

<p>  def get_proxy_bypass_domains(int)</p>

<pre><code>begin
  output = networksetup(['-getproxybypassdomains', int])
rescue Puppet::ExecutionFailure =&gt; e
  Puppet.debug("#get_proxy_bypass_domains had an error -&gt; #{e.inspect}")
  return nil
end
domains = output.split("\n").sort
return nil if domains.first =~ /There aren\'t any bypass domains set/
domains
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def exists?</p>

<pre><code>get_proxy_bypass_domains(resource[:name]) != nil
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def destroy</p>

<pre><code>networksetup(['-setproxybypassdomains', nil])
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def create</p>

<pre><code>networksetup(['-setproxybypassdomains', resource[:name], resource[:domains]])
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def domains</p>

<pre><code>get_proxy_bypass_domains(resource[:name])
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def domains=(value)</p>

<pre><code>networksetup(['-setproxybypassdomains', resource[:name], value])
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<h2>Testing the type/provider</h2>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it, we&rsquo;re done!  The last thing to do is to test it out.  You can
test out your provider in one of two ways: the first is to add the module to
the modulepath of your Puppet master and include it that way, or test it
locally by setting the <code>$RUBYLIB</code> environmental variable to point to the <code>lib</code>
directory of your module (which is the more preferred method since it won&rsquo;t
serve it out to all of your nodes without it being tested). Because this module
is on my system at <code>/users/glarizza/src/puppet-mac_proxy</code>, here&rsquo;s how my
<code>$RUBYLIB</code> is set:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
export RUBYLIB=/users/glarizza/src/puppet-mac_proxy/lib
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Next, we need to create a resource declaration to try and set a couple of
bypass domains. I&rsquo;ll create a <code>tests</code> directory and simple test file in
<code>tests/mac_proxy_bypassdomains.pp</code>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock tests/mac_proxy_bypassdomains.pp lang:puppet %}
mac_proxy_bypassdomains { &lsquo;Ethernet&rsquo;:
  ensure  => &lsquo;present&rsquo;,
  domains => [&lsquo;www.garylarizza.com&rsquo;,&lsquo;*.puppetlabs.com&rsquo;,&lsquo;10.13.1.3/24&rsquo;],
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s run Puppet and test it out:</p>

<p>{% codeblock %}
└▷ puppet apply ~/src/puppet-mac_proxy/tests/mac_proxy_bypassdomains.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for satori.local in environment production in 0.06 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]//Mac_proxy_bypassdomains[Ethernet]/domains: domains changed [] to &lsquo;www.garylarizza.com *.puppetlabs.com 10.13.1.3/24&rsquo;
Notice: Finished catalog run in 3.47 seconds
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you run this as a local user, you will be prompted by OS X to
enter an administrative password for a change.  Since Puppet will ultimately be
run as root on OS X when we&rsquo;re NOT testing out code, this shouldn&rsquo;t be required
during a normal Puppet run. To test this out (i.e. that you don&rsquo;t always have to
enter an admin password in a pop-up window), you&rsquo;ll need to <code>sudo -s</code> to
change to root, set the <code>$RUBYLIB</code> as the root user, and then run Puppet again.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it &ndash; looks like our code worked! To check and make sure it will notice a
change, open System Preferences, then the Network pane, click on the Ethernet
interface, then the Advanced button, then the Proxies tab, and finally note the
&lsquo;Bypass proxy settings&hellip;&rsquo; text box at the bottom of the screen (now do you see
why we automate this shit?!). Make a change to the entries in there and run
Puppet again &ndash; it should correct it for you</p>

<h2>Wait&hellip;so that was it?  Really?  We&rsquo;re done?</h2>

<p>Yeah, that was a whole type and provider. Granted, it has only one property and it&rsquo;s
not too complicated, but that&rsquo;s the point. We&rsquo;ve still got some latent bugs (the
network interface passed must be capitalized exactly like OS X expects it, we could
do some better error handling, etc&hellip;), and the type doesn&rsquo;t work with <code>puppet resource</code>
(yet), but we&rsquo;ll handle all of these things in the next blog post (or two&hellip;or three).</p>

<p>Until then, take this time to crack open a type and a provider for something that&rsquo;s
been pissing you off and FIX it!  Better yet, push it up to Github, tweet about it,
and post it up <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com">on The Forge</a> so the rest of the
community can use it!</p>

<p>Like always, feel free to comment, tweet me (@glarizza), email me (gary <strong>AT</strong> puppetlabs <strong>DOT</strong> com),
or use the social media platform of choice to get a hold of me (Snapchats may or may not
get a response. Maybe.)  Cheers!</p>
