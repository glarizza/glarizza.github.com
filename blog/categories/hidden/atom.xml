keep it positive! Be as wonderful as the world you want to live in!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Writing is theraputic; it&rsquo;s usually the frenetic transcription of wild thoughts
that come to me when I run, walk, or sit slave to the United flight of the
week. This piece, however, is quite possibly the hardest and most cathartic
thing I&rsquo;ve ever had to compose. I&rsquo;m writing it not necessarily to inform,
entertain, or to pursuade, but instead with the same desperation of someone
whom holds the rain in one hand and sand in the other. I&rsquo;m writing this
so I don&rsquo;t forget the only thing I have left of someone I&rsquo;d consider the best
friend I ever had: my memories of her.</p>

<p>The thing is &ndash; I&rsquo;ve had this article on my laptop for over a week now (note:
I started writing this in March; the reality is that it&rsquo;s been MONTHS), and
I can&rsquo;t seem to get it right. I&rsquo;ve written INCREDIBLY LONG tomes with crazy
amounts of detail, but it never feels &lsquo;done&rsquo; or &lsquo;right&rsquo;. I really want to give
some insight into the Tanny that <em>I</em> knew, but, at the end of the day, this
article is really for me&hellip;because I know she&rsquo;s quite comfortable with how she
lived her life, and I&rsquo;m still all over the map with mine :)</p>

<h2>Tanny from the block</h2>

<p>In my school age years, I was lucky enough to wake up AFTER the shitshow that
occurs when two teenage girls share a bathroom. Being the youngest in a family
of two older sisters, I was (mostly) shielded from the horrors born out of the
hormonal laments of middle school girls (but I DID have to get up between the
hours of Picture Pages and half-past my mother&rsquo;s call of &ldquo;GIRLS! YOU&rsquo;RE GONNA
BE LATE FOR SCHOOL!&rdquo;). The only reasonably prompt event of those mornings was the
arrival of the skinny girl with glasses who walked over from &ldquo;the back street&rdquo;,
Tanny Vonthron. Tanny (whose real name was &ldquo;Satanta, which was no name <em><em>I</em></em>
had ever seen on a keychain) usually meant one thing &ndash; it was time for my
sisters and Tanny to leave for school, and for the house to quiet-the-hell-down
just before Mr. Wizard (and, looking back, that could be what first drew me to
her).</p>

<p>Tanny was usually dressed in bright colors (come on, this WAS the 80s), sported
giant glasses, and had bangs and blonde hair for days (if &lsquo;a day&rsquo; starts at the
top of your head and ends at your shoulders). To say that she was a casualty of
the 80s would imply that ANYONE survived unscathed, but let&rsquo;s just say that
even Tim Gunn would have had extreme difficulty trying to &ldquo;make it work.&rdquo; Tanny
always a giant, friendly smile on her face that reeked of never having
a detention &ndash; if there was ever a stereotype of the smart, smiley
super-student, that was Tanny.</p>

<p>I had seen Tanny thousands of times between childhood and my
20s, but never really talked to her much (most likely because the moments we
shared together involved me wearing Ninja Turtle pajamas and her holding her
hippy-lunch waiting for the two hot messes I call sisters). In fact, the first
time I remember sharing space with her OUTSIDE of my mother&rsquo;s berber carpeting
was around the year 2000 when I started helping out with technology at the
school district I originally attended.</p>

<h2>I attempt a career</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE: I&rsquo;m totally including a ton of detail because, like I said, I don&rsquo;t
want to forget any of this. If you&rsquo;re interested in the part where I talk about
what Tanny meant to me and the last few years, be prepared to skip a bunch of
paragraphs :)</strong></p>

<p>Back then, Tanny was teaching Special Education to elementary school children,
and I was doing my best to fix the sad Mac faces of Apple 5260/120s (as
a college student who had come back to be an &ldquo;intern&rdquo;, of sorts, for the school
district I once attended). We made casual pleasantries as I updated her Special
Education reporting tool database, which is to say I said &ldquo;Hi, I need to update
your Special Education reporting tool database&rdquo; and did so in silence. When
I was done, I left with a nod, and that was about it. Elementary school
classrooms were always very weirdly-happy to me, and Tanny&rsquo;s was definitely the
epitome of the &ldquo;happy&rdquo; component. As long as I&rsquo;ve been aware of Tanny, her logo
has been the giant yellow smiley face. She has smiley face <em>EVERYTHING</em>. The
car she drives?  That would be a yellow year-2000 VW bug with the license plate
&ldquo;TANSBUG&rdquo;. Hopefully you&rsquo;re seeing the picture I&rsquo;m painting</p>

<p>Sometime around 2002, Tanny left Huron City Schools, and Ohio altogether, for
sunny North Carolina while I stayed in town and tried to wrap my head around
a TCP/IP network stack. Cut to the summer of 2005, and I&rsquo;m working in a back
office of the high school library when the principal waltzes in with Tanny in
tow. I remember flipping out with nerdy exuberance &ndash; not necessarily because it
was TANNY, but because I remembered that Tanny&rsquo;s personal computer was
a clamshell iBook, and I had just gotten in a shipment of new G5 Powermacs
(Look, for everyone who knows me NOW, you&rsquo;ve got to understand that the product
of &ldquo;me&rdquo; now is the result of years of learning social queues. I was 25, living
in the town I grew up in, working at the school I attended, and the only thing
that made me happy was working with computers.  Trust me; it was a bit tragic).
For SOME reason, I thought that this fresh stock of awesome Macs would be
a HUGE selling point in getting Tanny to work for the school district again (I
also thought that fedoras were cool back then &ndash; leave me the hell alone).
Later that day, I sang Tanny&rsquo;s praises to the principal and gave him something
like a 4-minute diatribe as to why he should absolutely hire Tanny this
instant.  It was totally unnecessary, and didn&rsquo;t sway him in the least, because
he already had a small mountain of recommendations from anyone who had ever
crossed Tanny&rsquo;s path (you&rsquo;d be a moron to not recognize how awesome Tanny was).
In the fall of 2005, I was freaking out trying to prepare for the beginning of
yet another school year (being the Director of Technology for the district at
this point), and Tanny started working for Huron City Schools again as
a special education teacher.</p>

<h2>It wasn&rsquo;t Stockholm, but we had the syndrome</h2>

<p>The Tanny Vonthron that I had &ldquo;known&rdquo; when I was younger and the Tanny Vonthron
of 2005 shared a couple of traits &ndash; they were both incredibly skinny, smiley, happy,
blonde, and positive individuals who always knew what to say, but the Tanny of
2005 had this quick, sarcastic wit about her. The measure of how much I&rsquo;m going
to like a person is usually whether or not they can keep up with the onslaught of
references I pull off the top of my head. Tanny ALWAYS caught every stupid
reference I threw and usually followed it up with a &ldquo;Nice!&rdquo; and another relevant
and even-funnier reference of her own. If you talked with her for any length of
time, you&rsquo;d get sucked into her shorthand &ldquo;language&rdquo; comprised of these references,
nicknames, and pseudonyms that were necessary when sharing drama in such a small
town where everyone is related and everyone was LISTENING (in later years, this
shorthand was also borne out of iPhone autocorrects that you would just run with &ndash; so
even when you saw &ldquo;Lola&rdquo;, &ldquo;Le Faceboom&rdquo;, &ldquo;GOL&rdquo;, &ldquo;gorp&rdquo; and whatever ducking phrase
the iPhone decided to mangle this week, you learned to be like Cover Girl &ndash; or
easy, breezy, and beautiful). Tanny knew the power of the inside joke, and
reveled in treating every verbal quip as a well-crafted riddle. She had the
&ldquo;elephant brain&rdquo; of the group, and thus could remember minutae. I loved to pride
myself on my ability to remember stupid obscure details, and we bonded almost
immediately.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true to say that you develop &ldquo;favorites&rdquo; wherever you work. For me, I
enjoyed the high school because the kids didn&rsquo;t cry as much when you openly
mocked them (and, being a former fat kid, I wielded a sharp stick of sarcasm
that I tended to jab with the most wanton of disregard). My sister Andrea
had come to work for the same school district as la profesora de Español,
which made things a bit more comfortable, and we had come to enjoy the snarky
sentiments of Brooke Kukay/Lorenz/Kukay &ndash; the senior english teacher who
wore black to match her cold, dead heart. We each shared a common love:
finding humor in the mundane, alcohol, and sushi (okay, maybe just the latter two,
but who&rsquo;s counting).</p>

<p>Like I said, Tanny was a high school intervention specialist
who dealt with special education children and helped them to adjust to HS work.
Throughout the day she would encounter children with amazing &ldquo;quirks&rdquo; that
others perceived as flaws. Some wanted things a particular way, others refused
to be touched, some had no concept of sarcasm, and many had issues reading
and reacting to emotions of others (while showing limited emotions themselves).
The coolest thing was, not only did Tanny consider these facets of every child&rsquo;s
personality, but she taught me to identify with them instead of judge them.
In reality, looking back on it, she was actually shining a light on certain
&ldquo;quirks&rdquo; in my own personality that I had never taken the time to face. She
was MASTERFUL at modeling correct behavior and being completely unflappable.
I was amazed that she could be completely drained yet put on the happy face
for some unhappy parent, disarm them with a smile, guide them to the answers
they needed to hear, and have them leaving like they had accomplished something.
I remember actually repeating phrases that she had used to myself to try
and remember them in case I was ever in the same situation. Here she was modeling
behaviors and teaching me how to become a better person, while simply trying
to escape an awkward situation of her own.</p>

<p>As for unflappable &ndash; that was Tanny&rsquo;s middle name. I have never seen her recoil
in the face of anything. You know the stories of flight attendents, soldiers,
and nurses who react as calm as Hindu cows in the face of trauma? That was
Tanny. The problem was &ndash; I&rsquo;m the kind of person that kicks sand on the line
you draw just to find your boundaries. It became a game to me to see how
casually I could drop the most candid, cringeworthy statements just to see if
Tanny would react. She never did. Ever. I&rsquo;m sure by now people will have posted
countless number of Tanny quotes and nuggets of information she shared with
all of us, but there was one key mantra that, <em>TO ME</em> defined Tanny: &ldquo;Never
let the bitches see you sweat.&rdquo; Now, I don&rsquo;t know that those were her actual
WORDS, but she was the complete embodiment of that phrase. Tanny never let
anyone have the power to break her. Ever. She wouldn&rsquo;t give anyone the benefit
of letting them see her shaken. To Tanny, losing yourself was losing the situation,
and that bitch never met a situation she didn&rsquo;t win.</p>

<p>Finally, Tanny was private to a fault. She bought a tiny little house in the
center of town and I had the opportunity to visit it a sum total of twice when
I knew her. Being one of those people who loved doing the &ldquo;drop in&rdquo; on people at
home, I couldn&rsquo;t understand her fear of having people visit. But it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fear&rdquo;,
per se, but mainly the concept of having your own space where you could retreat
and recharge. Where Tanny and I most strongly bonded was the fact that many
people would consider the both of us as extroverted, social creatures, but, in
reality, we not only favored being alone and to ourselves, but sometimes downright
DESPISED having to leave our four walls and be social. We would lament required
attendance at events and try to plan our getaways in advance. We had systems for
signaling the other to give a &ldquo;rescue call&rdquo;, where you telephoned to try and
save someone from an event/meeting/social interaction they were required to
have. At the end of the day, we wanted that &ldquo;Tanny Time&rdquo;, as we called it,
which was that time at home doing nothing but enjoying the company of one&rsquo;s
self.</p>

<h2>Rise of the basic bitches and putting the &lsquo;pal&rsquo; in Principal</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when it happened, I can&rsquo;t even point to exactly HOW it happened,
but Tanny, Brooke, and I became close. It could have been the fact that we were all
single in a town with an age gap between the ages of 18 &ndash; 36, it might have been
the fact that we put on a pleasant face and bit with sarcasm when you turned your
back, or it could have been a simple result of friendship by proximity, but
slowly we found ourselves communicating pretty frequently about the craziness of
the day (from stupid things like who&rsquo;s doing a reply-all to a news post, to
more important decisions like when Nagoya was going to begin half-price sushi
this year). We all had our hang-ups, ideosyncracies, and rituals, but instead
of being taboo, we laughed and celebrated them. It was good to &ldquo;belong&rdquo;.
Over time, monday night sushi dates became a thing, runs to Jim&rsquo;s Pizza Box
were common, and we bonded between the hours of work and &ldquo;alone time&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen that YouTube video by that kid Lohanthony where he spins his
leg and calls &ldquo;all basic bitches&rdquo;? You probably have, but if you&rsquo;ve NOT, then
check this out:</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dKY0FsUEMyw "></iframe></div></p>

<p>Somewhere along the line the three of us watched this video and kept referring
back to it (mainly that shit he does with his leg). Eventually, we started
calling each other &ldquo;basic bitches&rdquo;, or just BBs for short (because we ain&rsquo;t
got time for whole words). The name stuck, and Tanny would refer to her BBs
near and far.</p>

<p><strong>Note: I&rsquo;m certainly not stupid enough to presume that A.) we were Tanny&rsquo;s
only friends, B.) we were Tanny&rsquo;s &ldquo;best&rdquo; friends, or C.) I had any monopoly
on insight into Tanny&rsquo;s thoughts &ndash; I&rsquo;m only suggesting that we formed a bond
that we maintained up until this day.</strong></p>

<p>Around 2008, the school district restructured and opened an elementary school
for preschool children through 2nd grade. The district opened a search for an
elementary principal, and it turns out that the best candidate was right under
their noses. Tanny had completed her administrative certificate with other folk
who ended up working in our school district, and so when the position opened up
there was an outpouring of support for her. During that time, I sat on the
&ldquo;Administrative Leadership Team&rdquo; for the school district since the role of
&ldquo;Director of Technology&rdquo; was considered an administrative position (versus a certified or
classified position in the union). Because of this, Tanny asked me questions
how things worked. I won&rsquo;t begin to profess that I was her innermost confidant
(as I said earlier, she had friends who were principals in our school district,
and they were more than capable of answering her questions), but I will say that
we had a super casual and extremely down-to-earth bond that you would have with
someone with whom you&rsquo;d shared all your deepest and darkest secrets (well,
she knew all MY secrets &ndash; to know Tanny is to understand that you never truly
know all there is to know about her). Tanny was a shoe-in for the job, and the
Huron City School district had the smiliest goddamn principal in the tri-state
area :)</p>

<h2>&ldquo;How do YOU get cancer?&rdquo;</h2>

<p>I remember Tanny confessing that she had started feeling strange. She was very
much in-tune with her body, and she had some nagging suspicions about symptoms
that didn&rsquo;t add up. I remember her saying that she pressured her doctor into
doing some additional tests, and, low and behold, they had found some questionable
results.</p>

<p>Now, you&rsquo;ve got to understand, Tanny was the pinnacle of healthy living in my
book. She&rsquo;d been a vegetarian living in the midwest for as long as I knew &ndash;
that is a goddamn feat &ndash; she&rsquo;s been rail-thin forever, and she gave the
appearance of &ldquo;Miss Honey&rdquo; from Matilda to anyone that laid eyes on her. She
lived on positive energy, vegetables, and macaroni and cheese. For all intents
and purposes, she was the poster child for avoiding cancer, but here we were.</p>

<p>Tanny was methodical with everything she&rsquo;d ever done in life. This is the
woman who wouldn&rsquo;t go to Hawaii without a list of things she needed to accomplish,
the woman who would send HERSELF post cards home FROM Hawaii so she could
remember what it felt like being there, and the woman who had binders full
of tabs that separated all her monthly bills. Everything she ever researched
was tabulated and sorted according to whatever index made the most sense, and
she left absolutely no stone unturned; she was simply a voracious consumer of
information (which, frankly, is why I loved her &ndash; being in IT I thrived on
tearing things apart and understanding how the components came together to create a
stronger product). When Tanny was diagnosed with cancer, she knew it was going
to mean big changes for both herself as well as all the employees and students
at the school. She also knew that her privacy was going to be invaded. She
had the desire to tell people personally of her condition, but wanted it to
be a secret so she could control the flow of information. She had it SO planned
out that she made sure to reveal her secret in pairs, so that every person she
told had at least ONE other person they could go to in order to discuss what
they had learned. It was the most methodical goddamn reveal I&rsquo;d seen this side
of Extreme Home Makeover, but it worked.</p>

<p>I remember the day she broke the news to me. I was sitting in her office and
was DETERMINED to keep my shit together. I did not like to show emotion, I
enjoyed playing the jester and keeping things light, and this was entirely too
heavy for my taste.</p>

<p>But I crumbled.</p>

<p>My god did I crumble. I remember tilting my head back and staring up around her
office trying to will the tears back into my eyes. And my breakdown fed her
breakdown, which bothered me even more. Tanny did NOT like to cry in front
of people (though she&rsquo;d tell you that it was perfectly fine to do so). I hold
that same sentiment, so it was one of the hardest things for us to share. To
this day, it&rsquo;s the only time we&rsquo;d seen each other cry, and part of me is happy
that we let each other have the moment. My mind was reeling and all I could
think about was life without Tanny&hellip;and it hurt. It didn&rsquo;t compute. She wasn&rsquo;t
SUPPOSED to have bad things happen to her (except when she tried to fly anywhere
by plane, which was constantly a shitshow) &ndash; she was the pinnacle of optimism
and sunny days keeping the clouds away. I couldn&rsquo;t rationalize it. My entire
life revolves around me rationalizing some behavior I discovered, and this
simply did not add up. You want to piss off a kid who needs to understand their
environment? Give him some of this does-not-compute bullshit and expect them
to live with it. Man did it hurt.</p>

<p>I went home that night and I wrote a letter. I know Tanny still has it
somewhere, and I only VAGUELY remember what I wrote in it, but I poured
every raw emotion I had into it, stuffed it into a card, and left it for her.
It was the only way I could vent the building emotional pressure that I so
didn&rsquo;t want welling up inside me. And that was it. The next day, I was focused
on how she was going to kick ass with treatments and deal with this in true
Tanny-style.</p>

<h2>Cancer treatments are hell, and cisplatin is the devil</h2>

<p>Unfortunately for Tanny, &ldquo;true Tanny-style&rdquo; meant that she was going to go home
and browse the internet looking up the kind of cancer she had. She had told us
all she had cancer, and was somewhat vague about the TYPE of cancer, but that
was it.</p>

<p>As an aside, it&rsquo;s probably pertinent to explain a little something I like to
call &ldquo;The Tanny Truth&rdquo;. Tanny is the most honest individual I have EVER met in
my entire life. Being someone who freaks out MORE when I don&rsquo;t know ANYTHING
about something versus when I know the TRUTH about something (no matter how
terrible or embarrassing it is), I totally appreciated that Tanny would give
me the truth when I asked for it.</p>

<p>But you had to know HOW to ask for it.</p>

<p>You could ask Tanny a question like &ldquo;How is the cancer?&rdquo; (which would be an
incredibly rude question, but let&rsquo;s go with it), and she would respond &ldquo;I feel
great today!&rdquo;. The truth is that she DOES feel great, but she didn&rsquo;t actually
tell you ANYTHING about the cancer. Less experienced individuals would get
swayed by the response and would roll with it &ndash; exactly like she wanted. More
experienced individuals would rephrase the question and get a similar brush
off. After awhile, you recognized when you were getting the Tanny truth and
simply rolled with it because A.) It was Tanny and she was private, or B.)
She was actually trying to protect you. Either way, you&rsquo;re better off just
being deftly redirected like a stream in the woods versus trying to swim
against the current and trying her patience.</p>

<p>So, understanding how The Tanny Truth worked, I didn&rsquo;t pursue the line of
questioning about the type of cancer she had. It wasn&rsquo;t until years (truly,
YEARS) later that I found out exactly what a unique and aggressive form of
cancer she really had. In these immediate days after her diagnosis, she
discovered some truly terrible pictures of the type of cancer she had. I cannot
even begin to fathom what it was like for someone who had lived exceedingly
well and had planned out their life so meticulously to have their mortality
delivered to them courtesy of some scan results. I&rsquo;ll never be able to
understand the power she had to command to fight this MENTAL battle even before
the physical treatments had begun, but, again, this was Tanny and she was a
believer in the power of the self and positive attitudes.</p>

<p>To her credit, had I known the bleak picture the internet painted her at that
time, I would have been even more inconsolable than I had already been that
day in her office. I chatted with a friend recently who went through cancer,
and he summed it up better than I could: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in treatment, you&rsquo;re
in survival mode: you&rsquo;re fighting for yourself and focused on getting better.
Cancer is much worse for the people around you than it is for you.&rdquo; Thinking
about this years after the fact, I not only respect her privacy and decisions,
but love her for them.</p>

<p>The first round of treatments Tanny received were hell. The thought process was
that you deliver the harshest treatment immedately following diagnosis when
you&rsquo;re at your healthiest (and with the hopes that you can eradicate the
cancer when it&rsquo;s small). The treatments she received made her lose her hair
and delivered the harshest blow to her body. Here was this woman who couldn&rsquo;t
have weighed more than 110 lbs ANYWAYS, and she was receiving treatment that
made you lose weight and feel weak. Throughout the whole ordeal, she prided
her ability to NOT lose the weight but instead to keep on plan and upbeat.
I don&rsquo;t know how she did it, but she did. I won&rsquo;t dwell on the details, but
she spent the first summer after her first year as principal getting treatments
with the hope that she could return back in the fall. Who DOES that?! Tanny does.</p>

<p>Tanny&rsquo;s hair eventually grew back, she slowly came back to school, and eventually
resumed her role as Principal at Shawnee Elementary. As far as people knew, she
was back to 100% and ready to rock!</p>

<p>The relationship between Tanny and myself became much stronger and closer after
her cancer diagnosis. It was a considerable wake-up call that emphasized how
precious life is. One of Tanny&rsquo;s favorite quotes was:  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all terminal;
none of us knows our expiration date, so we&rsquo;d better make the most out of every
day that we&rsquo;ve been given.&rdquo; We both knew that, and I think it helped to eliminate
all pretense and allow us to be incredibly candid, open, and honest with each
other in every situation. Also, if you think I&rsquo;m trying to say that &ldquo;I took
care of Tanny,&rdquo; then you&rsquo;re sorely mistaken. That bitch STILL looked out for
me no matter how sick she felt. One of my favorite stories came from a trip to
San Francisco that I had taken in early 2010. I had gone out to San Francisco to
attend a conference, and had managed to leave my FAVORITE HAT at the New Delhi
restaurant on Ellis street. When I arrived back in Huron, I phoned the
restaurant and they had INDEED found my hat &ndash; but now how was I gonna get it?
Sure, they could mail it to me, but serendipity reared its head in the form of
Tanny&hellip;who had plans to visit San Francisco two short weeks after I had
returned. Tanny stopped into the restaurant, picked up my hat, and delivered it
back home to me when she returned. That hat became a staple of my outfit,
and many people I know in technology ONLY know me for that hat. The truth is,
that hat had new meaning to me the instant Tanny delivered it back to me.
Suddenly, it was a simple connection to her and a reminder of how she was
always there for me.</p>

<h2>Schools, fools, and coping tools</h2>

<p>Around the spring to summer of 2010, we were all closing out the school year,
entering into summer, and looking forward to the NICE three months in Ohio! Over
the course of that summer, &ldquo;things&rdquo;, well, how do I put it, &ldquo;HAPPENED&rdquo; between the
Superintendent of our school district and the Principal of another school district.
If you want to read about it, the Sandusky Register website has
<a href="http://www.sanduskyregister.com/fox-fiasco">a whole section dedicated to the situation</a>, and you can even
<a href="http://www.sanduskyregister.com/sites/www.sanduskyregister.com/files/3_Bd_Ex_4.pdf">read all the lovely emails with all the sordid details</a>.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things to do was to visit Tanny in her Principal&rsquo;s office
(which was BRIGHT YELLOW and full of Yodas and smiley faces) and chat about the
events of the day. This was especially fun in the summer because NOBODY was
around and we were able to talk without fear of interruption.</p>

<p>Working at a school district over the summer comes with a certain amount of
&ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; because the students and teachers aren&rsquo;t there, and you&rsquo;re mostly
surrounded by the cleaning/support and front-office staff. Anyone who&rsquo;s a good
administrator will tell you that their slowest AND busiest periods are during
the summer (wrapping up the current year, planning for the next). As the
director of technology, my summers were ABSOLUTELY busy and full &ndash; that&rsquo;s when
I took down systems, experimented with new workflows, and had to get everything
re-imaged and ready by the first day of school. Couple this with cleaning staff
who want to unplug everything to clean, and you have a recipe for some crazy
stuff</p>

<p>Anyways, here we would find ourselves at the end of the day in her office
talking about whom had showed up where, who was getting what work done, and
so on. I&rsquo;m totally fascinated by psychology (but I HATE sociology because
A PERSON is awesome, but PEOPLE, as a group, fucking scare me), and Tanny had
one of the best reads on people and body language that I had ever seen in my
life. She could detect the smallest of tells, and I usually had the background
information.</p>

<p>Previously, I told you that Tanny loved to refer to her &ldquo;elephant brain&rdquo;,
because it was just this steel trap of information. We BOTH grew up in the same
small town in which we were employed, so we BOTH had the same experiences with
the same families. Small town families run deep and you frequently see
generation after generation of family members funneling through the doors of the
schools. We LOVED &ldquo;connecting the dots&rdquo; and making connections about kids, their
parents, and whatnot. This sounds like small-town drama, and, make no mistake
about it &ndash; it totally is, but it&rsquo;s what you do to stay sharp and survive.</p>

<p>At any rate, the nature of my job was to be in every building nearly every day.
Also, I would go take pictures of all the sports and extra-curricular events,
couple that with managing all the user accounts and lots of data entry, as well
as a mind for remembering dumb things, and I basically held lots of names and
connections in my head. I&rsquo;d hear a kid&rsquo;s name, could tell you what grade and
school they were in, what sport they played, and most likely what group of kids
they hung out with. My job was information, and I was good at it because it
FASCINATED me.</p>

<p>Combine my fascination with Tanny&rsquo;s innate abilities and her amazing
&ldquo;elephant brain&rdquo;, and you can probably see where I&rsquo;m going. We would play this
little game of taking things that had happened and trying to correlate them
with other things we knew. For example, maybe someone spraypainted the
building or stole the flag from a flagpole, and all the cameras got were
shadowed glimpses of figures walking, Tanny could CSI the shit out of that
data. We also knew that kids never did ANYTHING alone and never shut up about
the things they did. Put these pieces together (combined with the fact that this
WAS a small town), and there wasn&rsquo;t anything that could get by Tanny. It&rsquo;s no
coincidence that one of Tanny&rsquo;s favorite TV shows was Scandal.</p>

<p>So, come the fall of 2010, and things feel very different in the district. I&rsquo;m
coming up on my 30th birthday, though, and am starting to feel like I&rsquo;ve squeezed
all the life I can out of Huron and my situation. I&rsquo;ve had job offers before,
but this was the first time that I&rsquo;d actually entertained them. In my mind,
Tanny was a big part of why I stayed in Huron. Her friendship meant the world
to me and I&rsquo;ve STILL, to this day, not met anyone else with whom I&rsquo;ve had a deep
connection like I did with Tanny. We could read each other&rsquo;s body language,
facial expressions, and immediately follow the stringy references we would
conjur up to avoid detection. I remember actually having the thoughts that
if Tanny died, I would have to leave Huron and pursue life elsewhere &ndash; I just
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stay in town and cope without having her there. As it turned
out, this process would happen much sooner than I expected&hellip;</p>

<p>One particularly attractive job offer turned up (the job I currently hold, as
a matter of fact), and I couldn&rsquo;t refuse it. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I
needed to leave Huron and move to Portland, Oregon. Tanny was the first person I told,
and I could tell that even though she was very happy for me, that a part of her
was equally sad that I was jumping ship and leaving town.</p>

<p>Just before this happened, though, another &ldquo;attractive offer&rdquo; had arisen that
caused me to make a difficult decision. I&rsquo;d always known that I was gay, but
never bothered to mention it to anyone else in town. Also, with the
previously-mentioned age gap, there was never anyone around my age that I felt
like I could hang out with. After 30 years, though, I had found someone that
I wanted to spend time with, and I needed to tell someone about it. Tanny was
the first person with whom I ever verbalized my feelings. Shockingly, this was
something she hadn&rsquo;t suspected &ndash; I was actually taken aback that I was able to
put something by the GREAT Tanny Vonthron, because that bitch missed NOTHING!
She was amazingly warm and super supportive, but part of me feels like she
was only this way because she and Brooke always wanted a gay BFF&hellip;</p>

<p>As my departure date drew near, Tanny organized a going away party that still
makes me smile :)  The show Portlandia had just become popular, and Portland
was being known as the city where &ldquo;The dream of the 90s was alive&rdquo; &ndash; that was
the theme of my going away party. Tanny had made little Sex in the City name
badges for everyone to wear (whether you were a Carrie or a Samantha, which
were Tanny and Brooke respectively. I can&rsquo;t remember who I was, but at least
I wasn&rsquo;t the whore), and had put together a &ldquo;going away&rdquo; box for me. Picture
a plastic storage bin (or actually LOOK at the picture on the left), but around
the inside wall of the bin she had printed out pictures of 90s CDs, TV shows,
and movies (Friends, Reality Bites, Seinfeld).  Inside I had all the
necessities for moving away &ndash; CDs she had burned with her favorite 90s songs,
books, pictures, and the like. She LOVED making personalized things like this,
and to this day I have that bin exactly the way she left it (mainly because
I&rsquo;m really lazy, but also partly because I&rsquo;m also nostalgic).</p>

<p>Once I had left, our communication was mostly limited to countless group
iMessages, phone calls, and occasional visits to Huron as I was passing through.
Phone conversations were pretty limited because my job mostly consisted of
traveling from one place to another, and I really hate to use the phone. When
we DID get a chance to talk on the phone, though, we tried to talk about everything
BUT Huron and what was happening at home. I think Tanny enjoyed talking to me
because I was outside of Huron and could share stories of things that weren&rsquo;t
going on in her backyard (also &ndash; there&rsquo;s only so much you can take of &ldquo;same shit,
different day.&rdquo;). Even though I was 2000 miles away, modern technology made it
feel like we were still nearby.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Fox Fiasco&rdquo;</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sanduskyregister.com/fox-fiasco">Earlier, I mentioned the &lsquo;fox fiasco&rsquo;</a>, which refers back to the
story of the former superintendent of Huron City Schools and his alleged
misdeeds. I have no desire to write anything about the former superintendent,
but I do want to write about how I believe the experience made Tanny feel.
Since there is pending litigation, I&rsquo;ll preface all of this with the statement
that these are my personal beliefs/opinions.</p>

<p>Before that &ndash; some background&hellip;</p>

<p>Tanny Vonthron was certainly the most honest person I&rsquo;ve ever met in life, and
the person whose moral compass consistently pointed due north for as long as
I&rsquo;d known her. Tanny&rsquo;s opinion of people aligned with how honest, moral, and
caring they were (among other things). She valued these three characteristics
above all others (in my opinion), and tended to surround herself with people
who demonstrated these three core values. Before she was a principal, Tanny
was an intervention specialist and she dealt with children who had any number
of issues that required special attention. Her favorite students were those who
landed on the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m incredibly honest, literal, and have problem reading and
expressing emotion&rdquo; level of the autism spectrum. She genuinely loved these
people because you know at any point in time where you stood with them (and,
if you didn&rsquo;t know, just ask them and they&rsquo;d tell you without hesitation).
Tanny was the personification of &ldquo;zero judgement&rdquo;, and loved these students
for every reason why others felt they were &ldquo;disabled&rdquo;. Tanny had this amazing
ability to reach them on their level, and I believe they genuinely felt she
was interested and willing to do anything to help them out (undoubtedly because
she actually WAS GENUINELY INTERESTED AND WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP THEM
OUT!). In the time I shared with her at school, I learned an absolute ton
about both the students and the autism spectrum on which they landed. Tanny
was super careful not to break confidentiality or share sensitive information,
but would talk in generalities and show me the &ldquo;human&rdquo; side of the human
condition. Looking back, I identified VERY STRONGLY with her students because
I actually empathized with them on many levels, and I feel that Tanny not only
loved my idiosyncrasies but tried to show me how ALL of us have our issues and
we&rsquo;re ALL a bit &lsquo;special.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Anyways, we&rsquo;ve established that Tanny valued honesty and morality, which you
would THINK would be the characteristics LEAST exhibited by someone who
allegedly had an affair during school hours &ndash; right?</strong></p>

<p>I feel very strongly that Tanny felt betrayed by her former boss (&lsquo;betrayed&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t nearly a strong enough word, in my opinion), especially considering these
events occurred while she was in treatment for cancer. I think she was even
more embarrassed when rumors started flying about her possible involvement with
her former boss. The rumors were categorically false (like I said, Tanny had
a moral compass that was cemented &lsquo;due north&rsquo;), but the accusations were enough
to cut her deeply (and, again, even though she felt upset, she never let it
show).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to say more, but I&rsquo;d also not like to feed into the ego of a few, so
we&rsquo;ll just leave it like that.</p>

<h2>The past year</h2>

<p>Tanny was diagnosed in April, 2009, and so in April, 2013, she celebrated her
4 year &ldquo;cancerversary&rdquo;.  She celebrated at Nagoya with some sushi (as one
does), but it also felt (to ME, at least) like an odd omen. Short of losing her
hair, you would never know that Tanny had any health issues. All of the sudden,
though, now she&rsquo;s hitting these &lsquo;anniversaries&rsquo; date and (thus far) beating the odds.
That wasn&rsquo;t how Tanny wanted to see it, though.</p>

<p>To know Tanny, and to share time with Tanny, was to concede to a couple of
&lsquo;conditions&rsquo; to her condition:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be positive</li>
<li>Be present</li>
<li>No goodbyes</li>
</ul>


<p>The first rule was non-negotiable. If you were being negative, she was removing
herself from the situation (see the quote at the top of the page).</p>

<p>The second is, as <em>I</em> see it, a more recent addition. See, Tanny was also the
plan-iest person I&rsquo;ve ever met. She had plans for the present, plans for the future,
plans for dinner, and plans to update her plans. She had binders, with tabs and
highlighted passages, for damn near everything. But, as the saying goes about
best laid plans, that was somewhat relaxed after Tanny was diagnosed. Sure, she
still had her plans, but she also did as MUCH as she could to absorb every
effervescent element around her as often as she could. Imagine her hugging a
card to her chest and closing her eyes for about 5 seconds &ndash; she would literally
try to pull the emotions and the moment into her to feel them race up her spine
and tingle those little neckhairs (See &ndash; that&rsquo;s my attempt writing to elicit
emotion; Mary Alice Harpster would be SO proud&hellip;). Tanny would clip all of
these little articles about teaching yourself to &lsquo;be more present&rsquo;, which,
at the time, I thought was kinda weird&hellip;but, then again, nobody was holding
a clock above MY head. As someone who is impulsive and wanders around life jumping
from one adventure to the next, it was kinda awesome to see her join me in what
SHE called &lsquo;being present&rsquo; but what I called &lsquo;another day&rsquo; :)</p>

<p>Finally, Tanny did NOT want to go through the &lsquo;goodbye&rsquo; phase. From the start,
she did as much as she could to not be PERCEIVED as &lsquo;sick&rsquo;. She hated losing
her hair, still kept up her immaculate appearance (and appearances), and fought
as hard as she could to remain &lsquo;just Tanny&rsquo;. She even had rules against &lsquo;sad
eyes&rsquo; (You know how when someone tells you something, like &lsquo;my dog just died&rsquo;,
and you immediately give them the &lsquo;sad eyes&rsquo;? You know what I&rsquo;m talking about &ndash;
you cock your head just slightly, raise your eyebrows, and affect that &lsquo;oh
my goodness&rsquo; tone. Yeah, Tanny would have none of that shit). So even if Tanny
wasn&rsquo;t doing well, you weren&rsquo;t allowed to gush about the perceived enormity of
it all &ndash; that would be conceding that she <em>WASN&rsquo;T</em> fighting and, thus, was
conceding to this invisible biological threat. No, she wanted absolutely none
of that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not say that we were all walking on eggshells for the past year, I&rsquo;m just
saying that for the first time since she was initially diagnosed it started to
feel&hellip;I dunno&hellip;more &lsquo;real&rsquo;? Because Tanny was who she was (because &lsquo;a fighter&rsquo;
is the clichéd emobodiment of &lsquo;an understatement&rsquo;), she demanded normalcy. And
normalcy is exactly what I (we) gave her. I kept flying around the damn world
preaching the good word of Puppet Labs, and she kept opening the school in
the morning, giving out smiley face awards, and seeing the kids off at the end
of the day (so to speak). I had something of a spoken &lsquo;unspoken&rsquo; rule with a
couple of close friends that they were to let me know as SOON as things were
&lsquo;not going well&rsquo; so that I could fly home to be there (knowing full-well that
Tanny would do no such thing). I never really got that &lsquo;call&rsquo;, but I did make
the call to come home between March 7th and 11th, 2014 based on a couple of
conditions.</p>

<p><a href="http://garylarizza.com/images/tanny/last_text_to_me.PNG"><img class="left" src="/images/tanny/last_text_to_me.PNG" width="400" height="400"></a>
<a href="http://garylarizza.com/images/tanny/last_call.PNG"><img class="left" src="/images/tanny/last_call.PNG" width="400" height="400"></a>
The last week of February I was working in Texas and was texting back and
forth with Tanny. We didn&rsquo;t really text TOO often, but the texts were coming
with a bit more frequency. On that thursday, the 27th, Tanny sent me a text
telling me to &lsquo;Call me when you can&rsquo;, which was really rare for Tanny (we
talked, but usually on weekends when she had downtime, and usually only to
catch up. This was like 3pm on a thursday, though, and so was a bit out of
character. When I called her, we talked about a bunch of random things
(ranging from happenings in Huron, where I was traveling, and the like), but
it was really laid-back and&hellip;I dunno&hellip;free of distraction? Tanny constantly
had texts, calls, people stopping by her office, and whatnot &ndash; this conversation
had NONE of that, and we just talked about whatever came up for about 40 minutes.
The conversation came to a close, and it REALLY started to feel like Tanny was
injecting a subtext that felt really&hellip;quotable (You know, things like &lsquo;well,
you know I want you to do whatever makes you happiest, and&hellip;&rsquo; that had an
air of finality). She ended the conversation with &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; (which was
something we started doing within the past year), and I felt really good that
I had been able to talk to her (since we hadn&rsquo;t really spoken since Christmas &ndash;
it was all texts).</p>

<p>After that call on Thursday, I would never received another call or text from Tanny
again.</p>

<p>I definitely started to get worried the following week when I didn&rsquo;t hear from
Tanny (but knew she liked her privacy, so tried to give her some space). After
hearing that another mutual friend had felt the same way and had booked a flight
home, I decided to do the same for the upcoming weekend. It was convenient that
my mother&rsquo;s birthday was the following week on March 12th, so that made for a
reasonable excuse, but, frankly, most people had started wondering about Tanny
over recent weeks after she&rsquo;d been progressively more absent from work. If you
were to take a drive around Huron, you would have seen yellow smiley faces
everywhere (I&rsquo;m talking flags, wood signs, stickers &ndash; you name it and people
were displaying it to support Tanny). It&rsquo;s definitely NOT hyperbole to say
that the community loved Tanny, and everyone wanted to show their support in
some way. Some suggested ideas were definitely crazier than others, but everyone&rsquo;s
heart was in the right place.</p>

<p>It would be dramatic to say that I flew home, sat beside her bed, held her
hand, and confessed every way in which she changed my life, but the truth is
honestly much more boring than that &ndash; remember, to know Tanny is to give up
your ability to deliver the &lsquo;goodbye speech&rsquo; to her. And don&rsquo;t think she wasn&rsquo;t
above sending people who started down that road RIGHT out of her room!
I definitely heard stories of her shoo-ing people out who began
very-clearly-rehearsed &lsquo;final words&rsquo; to her (I think THAT, most of ALL, makes
me laugh the loudest) :)</p>

<p>I would fly out of Cleveland bound for a work gig in Denver on March 11th, thus
missing her death by one day (yep, if you&rsquo;re keeping score, she died on my
mother&rsquo;s birthday).  There are very few things about me that I&rsquo;m guarded
about &ndash; most of everything about my life is sewn on my sleeve in very colorful
thread &ndash; but my feelings for and about Tanny are the some of the most precious
things I carry (ironic, considering this post).</p>

<h2>Immediately following</h2>

<p>Life was kind of a blur after Tanny died.  I don&rsquo;t know where to begin in
trying to describe how I felt, but I will share ONE story from that time
period:  One of the things I&rsquo;m very honored to have been able to do was
<a href="http://www.sanduskyregister.com/obituary/5434676">Tanny&rsquo;s Obituary</a>.  Tanny&rsquo;s
family had asked me to help out with it, and it was fun to open a Google doc,
start writing, and watch the rest of her family write comments and jokes while
I was giving birth to the thing. To say it was rough to write was an
understatement.  Tanny liked things to be&hellip;well&hellip;perfect. When she composed
a document, every word was chosen for a purpose, every sentence tied the
previous to the next, and the entire body of work was meant to convey a single
message. I could hear Tanny laughing at me as I spent tens of minutes fighting
over a single word. I could LITERALLY hear her family laughing at me as
I re-wrote entire sentences because they felt wrong.  Thinking I had a final
document, I called Brooke and asked her to read it with me.  I&rsquo;m REALLY glad
I did that because Brooke was able to give me some pointers on things I hadn&rsquo;t
even considered.  In the end, several people had a hand in putting that
document together, and I feel, like Tanny&rsquo;s life, it was made better by all the
people that were close with her.</p>

<h2>Life without Tanny</h2>

<p>It has taken me over two months to put this post together simply because
it&rsquo;s a painful thing to keep revisiting. I&rsquo;ve honestly written this post
on something like 20+ different flights, in countless states and countries,
and, always with the goal of &lsquo;finishing today&rsquo;. Part of me believes that I
can&rsquo;t finish it because I don&rsquo;t have Tanny around to help me work out my
thoughts :)</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve come to understand, though, is that the best parts of myself came
directly from Tanny. I made a conscious decision to not lie after watching her
model this behavior for 39 years (and, also, because I can&rsquo;t remember where
I put my KEYS let alone what I told someone, somewhere). Watching Tanny deal
with difficult situations and model behavior for her students taught me how to
be able to respectfully diffuse a situation. I could go on forever, but the
core idea was that she was THE ONE person that I had in my life that I KNEW
DEFINITIVELY would only do something with good intentions. Anytime Tanny said
or did something that I reacted even slightly negatively to, it helped me
to discover the flawed thinking in myself (the idea being that if I was upset
over something she said/did, but that I KNEW that Tanny didn&rsquo;t intend it to
be upsetting, what part of me was misinterpreting things?). I had absolutely
no idea how formative this was&hellip;until it wasn&rsquo;t around anymore.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also reached for my phone way too many times these past months &ndash; I will
see something, open up a text, and start writing a snarky little note&hellip;until
I remember. Sundays are particularly hard because that&rsquo;s when we usually talked.
Every time I meet a new person, or do something worth a story (which, frankly,
if you KNOW me happens almost hourly), I&rsquo;m reaching for my phone to tell someone
who&rsquo;s not going to write back again. It hurts.</p>

<p>Finally, I tend to process things a bit more slowly than normal people. When
Tanny died, I did everything I could to keep my shit together and &lsquo;stay strong&rsquo;
for everyone else.  I remember TRYING to have a breakdown and failing kinda
miserably at it.  It wasn&rsquo;t until very recently where I was talking somewhat
casually about Tanny that I just got hit with a wave of emotion. It hurt, but
it felt&hellip;welcoming. Coping is good (and, as The Shins say, caring is creepy).</p>

<h2>How do I even end this?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I have no idea what this post was about other than something of a
love letter for a friend. It&rsquo;s also helped me work out the MANY ways Tanny
helped me that I hadn&rsquo;t even remotely considered. It&rsquo;s also helpful in
answering the question &ldquo;Who was &lsquo;Tanny&rsquo; on your tattoo?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://garylarizza.com/images/tanny/tattoo.png"><img class="left" src="/images/tanny/tattoo.png" width="400" height="400"></a>
Yep, after Tanny died, a couple of us got tattoos.  The funny thing is that
I often talked with Tanny about wanting a tattoo on my wrists.  I even went
so far as to draw/paint them there a couple of times. My wrists are my &lsquo;prized
location&rsquo; because they&rsquo;re right out there (and I talk with my hands&hellip;I&rsquo;m Italian;
what do you want from me?). Ultimately I took that from a letter Tanny sent &ndash; it&rsquo;s
her handwriting and all &ndash; and it&rsquo;s really poignant because, as I mentioned
before, we didn&rsquo;t start saying &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; until recently, and it&rsquo;s something
I have hangups saying.  With Tanny, it was meaningful.  Every laptop I&rsquo;ve had
since Tanny was diagnosed has had a yellow smiley face on the right wrist rest,
and so I thought it was appropriate to put her writing there too.  I love that
I can see it everyday, and it&rsquo;s been really awesome to get daily reminders.</p>

<p>In the &lsquo;end&rsquo; (of this post, at least), I have to say that one of the biggest
things I pieced together with Tanny was the concept of &lsquo;regret&rsquo; being arguably
the worst word in the English language. It&rsquo;s something that basically means you
wish a period of time didn&rsquo;t exist.  Something SO TERRIBLE happened that you
not only want to have NEVER experienced it, but you feel like the lessons you
learned that time would be better spent by doing the situation all over again.</p>

<p>I truthfully have no regret in my life for any decision I&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>

<p>Tanny once said that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful for every good thing, every bad thing, and
every wise, stupid, rash, calculated, and wonderful decision you&rsquo;ve ever made
in your life because they&rsquo;ve made you the person you are, and they&rsquo;ve brought
you to this place, at this very moment, in life.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think I could say it
better &ndash; my life is at a wonderful place right now, and most of that is due
to the best person I&rsquo;ll ever know:  Tanny.</p>

<h2>-UPDATE-</h2>

<p>As is usually the case, I remember things (or learned things) after initially
making this post.  I had WARNED you that I didn&rsquo;t feel like this post was
finished, and so here we go&hellip;</p>

<h3>Portland Care Package</h3>

<p>I mentioned above that Tanny made me this lovely box of 90s nostalgia after
she found out that I was going to be moving to Portland (where the dream of
the 90s is STILL alive).  So, it turns out that&rsquo;s not entirely true&hellip;and
by that I mean that Shannon Smith came up with the idea :) I got a funny
Facebook message from Shannon filling me in on the deets and laughing at how
much I attributed to Tanny.  Personally, it makes for a better story, so Shannon&rsquo;s
just gonna have to cope and deal :)</p>

<h3>The numbers</h3>

<p>One of the things Tanny and I shared was this fascination with numbers. I have a
huge obsession with reducing everything to a single number and deciding if it&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;good&rsquo; number. The numbers 3, 9, and 11 were, for whatever reason, good numbers
for me (3 being a good number, 3 threes is 9, so THAT&rsquo;s a great number, and 11
is not only the date in which I was born, but is one of those &lsquo;special numbers&rsquo;).
I remember getting somewhat into numerology in my 20s (didn&rsquo;t we all&hellip;sigh), but,
honestly, the thing that REALLY gave me fucked-up superstitions was playing Craps
up at Casino Windsor with my dad and his friend Scott. Imagine a game FULL OF
numbers, and certain numbers that can cause you to lose all your money if they
come up (incidentally, if you know nothing about Craps you probably think that 7
is a REALLY good number&hellip;it&rsquo;s actually the opposite. The number 7 is SO BAD that
you can&rsquo;t even say it around a table or you&rsquo;ll get filthy looks. But I digress&hellip;).</p>

<p>Anyways, I had a habit of taking certain numbers and breaking them down to a
single number.  My old address was 517, and 5 + 1 + 7 is 13. Taking 13 and
breaking it down gets you 1 + 3 which equals 4, so my house &lsquo;was a 4&rsquo;. Weird?
Sure. But it&rsquo;s something I did in silent forever.  Even now when I stay in hotels
(which is weekly), the first thing I do is break the room number down into a single
number&hellip;and sometimes that&rsquo;s the ONLY way I remember my room number (&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,
it was an 8, I&rsquo;m on the fifth floor, and it&rsquo;s down this hall&hellip;ah yeah, it was room 503&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I remember one day Tanny and I went out to eat (at Marconi&rsquo;s, incidentally) where
we shared our love of numbers.  Tanny&rsquo;s special number was 33.  Why?  I honestly
don&rsquo;t remember exactly, but I believe it was because 33 was one of the master
numbers (like 11 is&hellip;which is my number).  Also the number 33 always came up
for Tanny, and she used it like a waypoint on the road of life.  We&rsquo;d always
get a random text from Tanny anytime she ran into a 33 SOMEWHERE, and she had
a metal number 33 in her car that had fallen off of one of the old lockers
(and was given to her I THINK by Mr. T &ndash; John Turinsky &ndash; but I could be
wrong).  Sometimes we would get a text at 3:33 just to say hi.  I really
miss those texts&hellip;</p>

<p>Tanny really didn&rsquo;t make TOO much of a secret about this, but it was definitely
&lsquo;her number&rsquo;.  Since then, I see 33s all over the place, and it&rsquo;s a friendly
reminder of her.  If you want to be let in on another secret, check out the
Sandusky Register website and look at the timestamps on any article that was
posted about her&hellip;</p>

<h3>The threesome and Tanny Time, the redux</h3>

<p>I alluded above that at times it felt like Brooke, Tanny, and I were connected
at the hip (and, like I said, that&rsquo;s not to say that Tanny wasn&rsquo;t connected with
ALL her other friends&hellip;it just felt like that to me).  We were SO connected that
John Ruf, when he was principal at HHS, would call us &ldquo;The Threesome&rdquo;.  Whatever
that meant.  A gay man and his two besties did not an awesome threesome make, but
whatever.  ANYWAYS, when I accepted the postion in Portland it felt like I was
breaking up the band (though it didn&rsquo;t happen like that, thanks to the marvels of
modern technology and Facetime).  I remember even getting a text that Tony Munafo,
who was vice principal at the high school at the time, was &ldquo;applying to be a new
member of The Threesome&rdquo;.  Let&rsquo;s just say that didn&rsquo;t end very well (#seatstaken).</p>

<p>Before I left, our threesome was at its peak.  We all worked pretty late (because
we liked the quiet and got work done when people weren&rsquo;t bugging us), so it was
common to get a call at my extension from Tanny and have it turn out to be a
three-way bullshit session.  Tanny would eventually tell us to meet her in her
office at like 5:30 to go get Jim&rsquo;s, Marconi&rsquo;s, or whatever local dish we were
craving, but we ALL knew that if Tanny said 5:30 it usually meant around 6:45.
Tanny operated on Tanny Time (I mentioned before that &ldquo;Tanny Time&rdquo; was the time</p>
